Infrastructure design solutions to provide increasing availability are described in a number of International Standards including the EN 50600 series. These solutions generally range from “single- path (no redundancy of components)” to “multi-path (fault tolerant even during maintenance)”. The power supply and distribution system provides an example of the relationship between absolute energy consumption (contribution to KPIs) and availability of service (level of SLA). Typically, IT equipment will be impacted by disruption of supply lasting longer than 10 ms and as a result, uninterruptible power supply (UPS) systems are generally used to support utility power grid systems unable to meet the IT equipment needs. IEC 62040-3 describes the topologies of UPS systems and, in general, the maximum efficiency for each technology reduces as the degree of protection increases. As a result, the availability architecture and the level of protection will dictate the contribution to KPIs which address energy consumption of the power supply and distribution system. Tolerance to faults and ensuring availability to meet SLAs are important factors in the energy consumption of data centre equipment and infrastructures including environmental control. The criticality level and redundancy employed to the power delivery, cooling, IT and IT support systems are key factors in the resource consumption, effectiveness or efficiency levels of the data centre. A.3 Data centre location Resource availability and consumption can be impacted by physical location. For example, free-cooling (compressor-less mechanical thermal management) is less effective for higher external temperatures. 10 Bibliography [1] IEC 62040-3, Uninterruptible power systems (UPS) — Part 3: Method of specifying the performance and test requirements [2] EN 50600 series, Information technology — Data centre facilities and infrastructures Price based on 11 pages', 'section_id': 'A.2', 'parent_id': 'A', 'parent_title': 'A non-compliance is not necessarily elevated to a nonconformity if, for example, it is identified and corrected by the environmental management system processes.

Infrastructure design solutions to provide increasing availability are described in a number of International Standards including the EN 50600 series. These solutions generally range from “single- path (no redundancy of components)” to “multi-path (fault tolerant even during maintenance)”. The power supply and distribution system provides an example of the relationship between absolute energy consumption (contribution to KPIs) and availability of service (level of SLA). Typically, IT equipment will be impacted by disruption of supply lasting longer than 10 ms and as a result, uninterruptible power supply (UPS) systems are generally used to support utility power grid systems unable to meet the IT equipment needs. IEC 62040-3 describes the topologies of UPS systems and, in general, the maximum efficiency for each technology reduces as the degree of protection increases. As a result, the availability architecture and the level of protection will dictate the contribution to KPIs which address energy consumption of the power supply and distribution system. Tolerance to faults and ensuring availability to meet SLAs are important factors in the energy consumption of data centre equipment and infrastructures including environmental control. The criticality level and redundancy employed to the power delivery, cooling, IT and IT support systems are key factors in the resource consumption, effectiveness or efficiency levels of the data centre. A.3 Data centre location Resource availability and consumption can be impacted by physical location. For example, free-cooling (compressor-less mechanical thermal management) is less effective for higher external temperatures. 10 Bibliography [1] IEC 62040-3, Uninterruptible power systems (UPS) — Part 3: Method of specifying the performance and test requirements [2] EN 50600 series, Information technology — Data centre facilities and infrastructures Price based on 11 pages', 'section_id': 'A.2', 'parent_id': 'A', 'parent_title': 'A non-compliance is not necessarily elevated to a nonconformity if, for example, it is identified and corrected by the environmental management system processes.

Infrastructure design solutions to provide increasing availability are described in a number of International Standards including the EN 50600 series. These solutions generally range from “single- path (no redundancy of components)” to “multi-path (fault tolerant even during maintenance)”. The power supply and distribution system provides an example of the relationship between absolute energy consumption (contribution to KPIs) and availability of service (level of SLA). Typically, IT equipment will be impacted by disruption of supply lasting longer than 10 ms and as a result, uninterruptible power supply (UPS) systems are generally used to support utility power grid systems unable to meet the IT equipment needs. IEC 62040-3 describes the topologies of UPS systems and, in general, the maximum efficiency for each technology reduces as the degree of protection increases. As a result, the availability architecture and the level of protection will dictate the contribution to KPIs which address energy consumption of the power supply and distribution system. Tolerance to faults and ensuring availability to meet SLAs are important factors in the energy consumption of data centre equipment and infrastructures including environmental control. The criticality level and redundancy employed to the power delivery, cooling, IT and IT support systems are key factors in the resource consumption, effectiveness or efficiency levels of the data centre. A.3 Data centre location Resource availability and consumption can be impacted by physical location. For example, free-cooling (compressor-less mechanical thermal management) is less effective for higher external temperatures. 10 Bibliography [1] IEC 62040-3, Uninterruptible power systems (UPS) — Part 3: Method of specifying the performance and test requirements [2] EN 50600 series, Information technology — Data centre facilities and infrastructures Price based on 11 pages', 'section_id': 'A.2', 'parent_id': 'A', 'parent_title': 'A non-compliance is not necessarily elevated to a nonconformity if, for example, it is identified and corrected by the environmental management system processes.

Infrastructure design solutions to provide increasing availability are described in a number of International Standards including the EN 50600 series. These solutions generally range from “single- path (no redundancy of components)” to “multi-path (fault tolerant even during maintenance)”. The power supply and distribution system provides an example of the relationship between absolute energy consumption (contribution to KPIs) and availability of service (level of SLA). Typically, IT equipment will be impacted by disruption of supply lasting longer than 10 ms and as a result, uninterruptible power supply (UPS) systems are generally used to support utility power grid systems unable to meet the IT equipment needs. IEC 62040-3 describes the topologies of UPS systems and, in general, the maximum efficiency for each technology reduces as the degree of protection increases. As a result, the availability architecture and the level of protection will dictate the contribution to KPIs which address energy consumption of the power supply and distribution system. Tolerance to faults and ensuring availability to meet SLAs are important factors in the energy consumption of data centre equipment and infrastructures including environmental control. The criticality level and redundancy employed to the power delivery, cooling, IT and IT support systems are key factors in the resource consumption, effectiveness or efficiency levels of the data centre. A.3 Data centre location Resource availability and consumption can be impacted by physical location. For example, free-cooling (compressor-less mechanical thermal management) is less effective for higher external temperatures. 10 Bibliography [1] IEC 62040-3, Uninterruptible power systems (UPS) — Part 3: Method of specifying the performance and test requirements [2] EN 50600 series, Information technology — Data centre facilities and infrastructures Price based on 11 pages', 'section_id': 'A.2', 'parent_id': 'A', 'parent_title': 'A non-compliance is not necessarily elevated to a nonconformity if, for example, it is identified and corrected by the environmental management system processes.

Infrastructure design solutions to provide increasing availability are described in a number of International Standards including the EN 50600 series. These solutions generally range from “single- path (no redundancy of components)” to “multi-path (fault tolerant even during maintenance)”. The power supply and distribution system provides an example of the relationship between absolute energy consumption (contribution to KPIs) and availability of service (level of SLA). Typically, IT equipment will be impacted by disruption of supply lasting longer than 10 ms and as a result, uninterruptible power supply (UPS) systems are generally used to support utility power grid systems unable to meet the IT equipment needs. IEC 62040-3 describes the topologies of UPS systems and, in general, the maximum efficiency for each technology reduces as the degree of protection increases. As a result, the availability architecture and the level of protection will dictate the contribution to KPIs which address energy consumption of the power supply and distribution system. Tolerance to faults and ensuring availability to meet SLAs are important factors in the energy consumption of data centre equipment and infrastructures including environmental control. The criticality level and redundancy employed to the power delivery, cooling, IT and IT support systems are key factors in the resource consumption, effectiveness or efficiency levels of the data centre. A.3 Data centre location Resource availability and consumption can be impacted by physical location. For example, free-cooling (compressor-less mechanical thermal management) is less effective for higher external temperatures. 10 Bibliography [1] IEC 62040-3, Uninterruptible power systems (UPS) — Part 3: Method of specifying the performance and test requirements [2] EN 50600 series, Information technology — Data centre facilities and infrastructures Price based on 11 pages', 'section_id': 'A.2', 'parent_id': 'A', 'parent_title': 'A non-compliance is not necessarily elevated to a nonconformity if, for example, it is identified and corrected by the environmental management system processes.

This International Standard is intended for use by an organization seeking to manage its environmental responsibilities in a systematic manner that contributes to the environmental pillar of sustainability. This International Standard helps an organization achieve the intended outcomes of its environmental management system, which provide value for the environment, the organization itself and interested parties. Consistent with the organization’s environmental policy, the intended outcomes of an environmental management system include: — enhancement of environmental performance; — fulfilment of compliance obligations; — achievement of environmental objectives. This International Standard is applicable to any organization, regardless of size, type and nature, and applies to the environmental aspects of its activities, products and services that the organization determines it can either control or influence considering a life cycle perspective. This International Standard does not state specific environmental performance criteria. This International Standard can be used in whole or in part to systematically improve environmental management. Claims of conformity to this International Standard, however, are not acceptable unless all its requirements are incorporated into an organization’s environmental management system and fulfilled without exclusion.', 'section_id': '1', 'parent_id': '', 'parent_title': '', 'requirement_tag': 'General', 'source': 'ISO standards\\ISO_14001_2015(en).pdf'}}, {'ID': 'e44bf4bc-3a0e-40e8-9f19-8a88711ceb77', 'rrf_score': 0.015384615384615385, 'payload': {'content': 'A.6.3\nEnergy review The process of identification of energy types and evaluation of energy use and energy consumption leads the organization to determine areas of significant energy use and identify opportunities for improving energy performance. In determining its SEUs, the organization determines the criteria for what is substantial energy consumption and/or what is a considerable potential for energy performance improvement. SEUs can be defined depending on the needs of the organization, such as by facility (e.g. warehouse, factory, office), by process or system (e.g. lighting, steam, transport, electrolysis, motor- driven) or equipment (e.g. motor, boiler). Once identified, the management and control of SEUs are an integral part of the EnMS. Person(s) working under the control of the organization can include service contractors, part-time personnel and temporary staff. 22 Updating the energy review includes updating the data and information related to the analysis of energy use and energy consumption, determination of SEUs and identification of opportunities for improving energy performance. Not all parts of the energy review need to be updated at the same time. A formal energy audit can be used to assist in identifying opportunities for energy performance improvement in detail. An energy audit can provide information on one or more parts of the energy review. The scope of an energy audit can comprise a detailed review of the energy performance of an organization, SEU(s), systems, energy-using processes and/or equipment. It is typically based on appropriate measurement and observation of actual energy performance for the defined energy audit scope. Energy audit outputs typically include information on current energy consumption and energy performance, and they can be accompanied by a series of specific recommendations ranked by energy performance improvement or financial return on investment, based on analysis of specific site data and operating conditions. When looking for energy performance improvement opportunities, organizations should consider the extent to which energy is required for a particular process, or is recoverable. Even where a process such as a chemical reaction has limited improvement opportunities due to the energy requirements based on scientific laws, the auxiliary equipment can offer significant energy performance improvement potential, as can improved process control or equipment scheduling. Opportunities can also emerge over time due to changes in operating loads and parameters, equipment degradation and improvements in available technologies and techniques. Opportunities can also be identified in how equipment and systems are operated and maintained. The installation of a renewable energy type within the scope and boundaries of the EnMS, as defined by the organization, does not represent an energy performance improvement. Energy consumption across the boundary can decrease, however, there will be no measurable improvement in energy efficiency or energy consumption related to energy use as a result of the change. The consumption of renewable energy can have a positive environmental effect and other benefits and an organization can have an objective to increase its installation of renewable energy. In such cases, an organization needs to assess the renewable energy production separately.

Infrastructure design solutions to provide increasing availability are described in a number of International Standards including the EN 50600 series. These solutions generally range from “single- path (no redundancy of components)” to “multi-path (fault tolerant even during maintenance)”. The power supply and distribution system provides an example of the relationship between absolute energy consumption (contribution to KPIs) and availability of service (level of SLA). Typically, IT equipment will be impacted by disruption of supply lasting longer than 10 ms and as a result, uninterruptible power supply (UPS) systems are generally used to support utility power grid systems unable to meet the IT equipment needs. IEC 62040-3 describes the topologies of UPS systems and, in general, the maximum efficiency for each technology reduces as the degree of protection increases. As a result, the availability architecture and the level of protection will dictate the contribution to KPIs which address energy consumption of the power supply and distribution system. Tolerance to faults and ensuring availability to meet SLAs are important factors in the energy consumption of data centre equipment and infrastructures including environmental control. The criticality level and redundancy employed to the power delivery, cooling, IT and IT support systems are key factors in the resource consumption, effectiveness or efficiency levels of the data centre. A.3 Data centre location Resource availability and consumption can be impacted by physical location. For example, free-cooling (compressor-less mechanical thermal management) is less effective for higher external temperatures. 10 Bibliography [1] IEC 62040-3, Uninterruptible power systems (UPS) — Part 3: Method of specifying the performance and test requirements [2] EN 50600 series, Information technology — Data centre facilities and infrastructures Price based on 11 pages', 'section_id': 'A.2', 'parent_id': 'A', 'parent_title': 'A non-compliance is not necessarily elevated to a nonconformity if, for example, it is identified and corrected by the environmental management system processes.

Infrastructure design solutions to provide increasing availability are described in a number of International Standards including the EN 50600 series. These solutions generally range from “single- path (no redundancy of components)” to “multi-path (fault tolerant even during maintenance)”. The power supply and distribution system provides an example of the relationship between absolute energy consumption (contribution to KPIs) and availability of service (level of SLA). Typically, IT equipment will be impacted by disruption of supply lasting longer than 10 ms and as a result, uninterruptible power supply (UPS) systems are generally used to support utility power grid systems unable to meet the IT equipment needs. IEC 62040-3 describes the topologies of UPS systems and, in general, the maximum efficiency for each technology reduces as the degree of protection increases. As a result, the availability architecture and the level of protection will dictate the contribution to KPIs which address energy consumption of the power supply and distribution system. Tolerance to faults and ensuring availability to meet SLAs are important factors in the energy consumption of data centre equipment and infrastructures including environmental control. The criticality level and redundancy employed to the power delivery, cooling, IT and IT support systems are key factors in the resource consumption, effectiveness or efficiency levels of the data centre. A.3 Data centre location Resource availability and consumption can be impacted by physical location. For example, free-cooling (compressor-less mechanical thermal management) is less effective for higher external temperatures. 10 Bibliography [1] IEC 62040-3, Uninterruptible power systems (UPS) — Part 3: Method of specifying the performance and test requirements [2] EN 50600 series, Information technology — Data centre facilities and infrastructures Price based on 11 pages', 'section_id': 'A.2', 'parent_id': 'A', 'parent_title': 'A non-compliance is not necessarily elevated to a nonconformity if, for example, it is identified and corrected by the environmental management system processes.

In determining its SEUs, the organization determines the criteria for what is substantial energy consumption and/or what is a considerable potential for energy performance improvement. SEUs can be defined depending on the needs of the organization, such as by facility (e.g. warehouse, factory, office), by process or system (e.g. lighting, steam, transport, electrolysis, motor- driven) or equipment (e.g. motor, boiler). Once identified, the management and control of SEUs are an integral part of the EnMS. Person(s) working under the control of the organization can include service contractors, part-time personnel and temporary staff. 22 Updating the energy review includes updating the data and information related to the analysis of energy use and energy consumption, determination of SEUs and identification of opportunities for improving energy performance. Not all parts of the energy review need to be updated at the same time. A formal energy audit can be used to assist in identifying opportunities for energy performance improvement in detail. An energy audit can provide information on one or more parts of the energy review. The scope of an energy audit can comprise a detailed review of the energy performance of an organization, SEU(s), systems, energy-using processes and/or equipment. It is typically based on appropriate measurement and observation of actual energy performance for the defined energy audit scope. Energy audit outputs typically include information on current energy consumption and energy performance, and they can be accompanied by a series of specific recommendations ranked by energy performance improvement or financial return on investment, based on analysis of specific site data and operating conditions. When looking for energy performance improvement opportunities, organizations should consider the extent to which energy is required for a particular process, or is recoverable. Even where a process such as a chemical reaction has limited improvement opportunities due to the energy requirements based on scientific laws, the auxiliary equipment can offer significant energy performance improvement potential, as can improved process control or equipment scheduling. Opportunities can also emerge over time due to changes in operating loads and parameters, equipment degradation and improvements in available technologies and techniques. Opportunities can also be identified in how equipment and systems are operated and maintained. The installation of a renewable energy type within the scope and boundaries of the EnMS, as defined by the organization, does not represent an energy performance improvement. Energy consumption across the boundary can decrease, however, there will be no measurable improvement in energy efficiency or energy consumption related to energy use as a result of the change. The consumption of renewable energy can have a positive environmental effect and other benefits and an organization can have an objective to increase its installation of renewable energy.

Infrastructure design solutions to provide increasing availability are described in a number of International Standards including the EN 50600 series. These solutions generally range from “single- path (no redundancy of components)” to “multi-path (fault tolerant even during maintenance)”. The power supply and distribution system provides an example of the relationship between absolute energy consumption (contribution to KPIs) and availability of service (level of SLA). Typically, IT equipment will be impacted by disruption of supply lasting longer than 10 ms and as a result, uninterruptible power supply (UPS) systems are generally used to support utility power grid systems unable to meet the IT equipment needs. IEC 62040-3 describes the topologies of UPS systems and, in general, the maximum efficiency for each technology reduces as the degree of protection increases. As a result, the availability architecture and the level of protection will dictate the contribution to KPIs which address energy consumption of the power supply and distribution system. Tolerance to faults and ensuring availability to meet SLAs are important factors in the energy consumption of data centre equipment and infrastructures including environmental control. The criticality level and redundancy employed to the power delivery, cooling, IT and IT support systems are key factors in the resource consumption, effectiveness or efficiency levels of the data centre. A.3 Data centre location Resource availability and consumption can be impacted by physical location. For example, free-cooling (compressor-less mechanical thermal management) is less effective for higher external temperatures. 10 Bibliography [1] IEC 62040-3, Uninterruptible power systems (UPS) — Part 3: Method of specifying the performance and test requirements [2] EN 50600 series, Information technology — Data centre facilities and infrastructures Price based on 11 pages', 'section_id': 'A.2', 'parent_id': 'A', 'parent_title': 'A non-compliance is not necessarily elevated to a nonconformity if, for example, it is identified and corrected by the environmental management system processes.

Infrastructure design solutions to provide increasing availability are described in a number of International Standards including the EN 50600 series. These solutions generally range from “single- path (no redundancy of components)” to “multi-path (fault tolerant even during maintenance)”. The power supply and distribution system provides an example of the relationship between absolute energy consumption (contribution to KPIs) and availability of service (level of SLA). Typically, IT equipment will be impacted by disruption of supply lasting longer than 10 ms and as a result, uninterruptible power supply (UPS) systems are generally used to support utility power grid systems unable to meet the IT equipment needs. IEC 62040-3 describes the topologies of UPS systems and, in general, the maximum efficiency for each technology reduces as the degree of protection increases. As a result, the availability architecture and the level of protection will dictate the contribution to KPIs which address energy consumption of the power supply and distribution system. Tolerance to faults and ensuring availability to meet SLAs are important factors in the energy consumption of data centre equipment and infrastructures including environmental control. The criticality level and redundancy employed to the power delivery, cooling, IT and IT support systems are key factors in the resource consumption, effectiveness or efficiency levels of the data centre. A.3 Data centre location Resource availability and consumption can be impacted by physical location. For example, free-cooling (compressor-less mechanical thermal management) is less effective for higher external temperatures. 10 Bibliography [1] IEC 62040-3, Uninterruptible power systems (UPS) — Part 3: Method of specifying the performance and test requirements [2] EN 50600 series, Information technology — Data centre facilities and infrastructures Price based on 11 pages', 'section_id': 'A.2', 'parent_id': 'A', 'parent_title': 'A non-compliance is not necessarily elevated to a nonconformity if, for example, it is identified and corrected by the environmental management system processes.

Infrastructure design solutions to provide increasing availability are described in a number of International Standards including the EN 50600 series. These solutions generally range from “single- path (no redundancy of components)” to “multi-path (fault tolerant even during maintenance)”. The power supply and distribution system provides an example of the relationship between absolute energy consumption (contribution to KPIs) and availability of service (level of SLA). Typically, IT equipment will be impacted by disruption of supply lasting longer than 10 ms and as a result, uninterruptible power supply (UPS) systems are generally used to support utility power grid systems unable to meet the IT equipment needs. IEC 62040-3 describes the topologies of UPS systems and, in general, the maximum efficiency for each technology reduces as the degree of protection increases. As a result, the availability architecture and the level of protection will dictate the contribution to KPIs which address energy consumption of the power supply and distribution system. Tolerance to faults and ensuring availability to meet SLAs are important factors in the energy consumption of data centre equipment and infrastructures including environmental control. The criticality level and redundancy employed to the power delivery, cooling, IT and IT support systems are key factors in the resource consumption, effectiveness or efficiency levels of the data centre. A.3 Data centre location Resource availability and consumption can be impacted by physical location. For example, free-cooling (compressor-less mechanical thermal management) is less effective for higher external temperatures. 10 Bibliography [1] IEC 62040-3, Uninterruptible power systems (UPS) — Part 3: Method of specifying the performance and test requirements [2] EN 50600 series, Information technology — Data centre facilities and infrastructures Price based on 11 pages', 'section_id': 'A.2', 'parent_id': 'A', 'parent_title': 'A non-compliance is not necessarily elevated to a nonconformity if, for example, it is identified and corrected by the environmental management system processes.
