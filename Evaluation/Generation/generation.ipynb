       "['A.2 Data\\tcentre\\tavailability\\tobjectives\\nThe availability objectives of a data centre can restrict such improvements due to the use of redundant infrastructure components and infrastructures necessary to respond the following circumstances: a) the user of the data centre will either set or demand a series of service level agreements (SLAs) based upon the criticality of their business case covering continuity and quality of power and environmental control provision, connectivity and security; b) the SLAs will reflect directly the appetite for risk that the user has and their ability or willingness to accept shutdowns for maintenance and repairs in the critical systems; c) data centres whose users can accept high levels of risk, scheduled shutdowns for maintenance and shutdowns for fault repair can reach very low design KPIs; d) data centres whose users cannot accept risk of failure and demand concurrent maintenance and inherent fault tolerance are limited by those SLAs to a higher design (and actual) KPI than those facilities described above. Infrastructure design solutions to provide increasing availability are described in a number of International Standards including the EN 50600 series. These solutions generally range from “single- path (no redundancy of components)” to “multi-path (fault tolerant even during maintenance)”. The power supply and distribution system provides an example of the relationship between absolute energy consumption (contribution to KPIs) and availability of service (level of SLA). Typically, IT equipment will be impacted by disruption of supply lasting longer than 10 ms and as a result, uninterruptible power supply (UPS) systems are generally used to support utility power grid systems unable to meet the IT equipment needs. IEC 62040-3 describes the topologies of UPS systems and, in general, the maximum efficiency for each technology reduces as the degree of protection increases. As a result, the availability architecture and the level of protection will dictate the contribution to KPIs which address energy consumption of the power supply and distribution system. Tolerance to faults and ensuring availability to meet SLAs are important factors in the energy consumption of data centre equipment and infrastructures including environmental control. The criticality level and redundancy employed to the power delivery, cooling, IT and IT support systems are key factors in the resource consumption, effectiveness or efficiency levels of the data centre. A.3 Data centre location Resource availability and consumption can be impacted by physical location. For example, free-cooling (compressor-less mechanical thermal management) is less effective for higher external temperatures. 10 Bibliography [1] IEC 62040-3, Uninterruptible power systems (UPS) — Part 3: Method of specifying the performance and test requirements [2] EN 50600 series, Information technology — Data centre facilities and infrastructures Price based on 11 pages',\n",

       "['A.2 Data\\tcentre\\tavailability\\tobjectives\\nThe availability objectives of a data centre can restrict such improvements due to the use of redundant infrastructure components and infrastructures necessary to respond the following circumstances: a) the user of the data centre will either set or demand a series of service level agreements (SLAs) based upon the criticality of their business case covering continuity and quality of power and environmental control provision, connectivity and security; b) the SLAs will reflect directly the appetite for risk that the user has and their ability or willingness to accept shutdowns for maintenance and repairs in the critical systems; c) data centres whose users can accept high levels of risk, scheduled shutdowns for maintenance and shutdowns for fault repair can reach very low design KPIs; d) data centres whose users cannot accept risk of failure and demand concurrent maintenance and inherent fault tolerance are limited by those SLAs to a higher design (and actual) KPI than those facilities described above. Infrastructure design solutions to provide increasing availability are described in a number of International Standards including the EN 50600 series. These solutions generally range from “single- path (no redundancy of components)” to “multi-path (fault tolerant even during maintenance)”. The power supply and distribution system provides an example of the relationship between absolute energy consumption (contribution to KPIs) and availability of service (level of SLA). Typically, IT equipment will be impacted by disruption of supply lasting longer than 10 ms and as a result, uninterruptible power supply (UPS) systems are generally used to support utility power grid systems unable to meet the IT equipment needs. IEC 62040-3 describes the topologies of UPS systems and, in general, the maximum efficiency for each technology reduces as the degree of protection increases. As a result, the availability architecture and the level of protection will dictate the contribution to KPIs which address energy consumption of the power supply and distribution system. Tolerance to faults and ensuring availability to meet SLAs are important factors in the energy consumption of data centre equipment and infrastructures including environmental control. The criticality level and redundancy employed to the power delivery, cooling, IT and IT support systems are key factors in the resource consumption, effectiveness or efficiency levels of the data centre. A.3 Data centre location Resource availability and consumption can be impacted by physical location. For example, free-cooling (compressor-less mechanical thermal management) is less effective for higher external temperatures. 10 Bibliography [1] IEC 62040-3, Uninterruptible power systems (UPS) — Part 3: Method of specifying the performance and test requirements [2] EN 50600 series, Information technology — Data centre facilities and infrastructures Price based on 11 pages',\n",

While this information addresses and is consistent with these requirements, it is not intended to add to, subtract from, or in any way modify them. The requirements in this International Standard need to be viewed from a systems or holistic perspective. The user should not read a particular sentence or clause of this International Standard in isolation from other clauses. There is an interrelationship between the requirements in some clauses and the requirements in other clauses.

['CoC No: 4.1.6, Name: IT equipment power usage against inlet temperature, Description: When selecting new IT equipment require the vendor to supply at minimum the total system power for a range of temperatures covering the full allowable inlet temperature range for the equipment at 100% load on a specified recognised benchmark such as Linpack, SERT (http://www.spec.org/sert/) or SPEC Power http://www.spec.org/power_ssj2008/). Data should be provided for 5Â°C or smaller steps of inlet temperature. As a minimum comply with the EU EcoDesign Directive and Lot 9 amendments to EU Commission regulation for servers and online storage systems. Considered optional but recommended; Total system power covering the full allowable inlet temperature range under 0% and 50% load on the selected benchmark. These sets of data shown easily in a single table and single chart will allow a data centre operator to select equipment to meet their chosen operating temperature range without significant increase in power consumption. This Practice is intended to improve the thermal performance of IT equipment by allowing operators to avoid devices with compromised cooling designs and creating a market pressure toward devices which operate equally well at increased intake temperature. Consider referencing and using the current U.S. EPA ENERGY STAR specifications for Servers. Consider referencing and using the current U.S. EPA ENERGY STAR specifications for Data Center Storage..', '4.1.6', 'IT equipment power usage against inlet temperature', 'New IT Equipment', 'Updated & approved IT equipment selection & procurement process', 'Organisations shall require the suppliers of IT equipment to deliver a report on the total power consumption of the system at different inlet temperature levels (in 5Â°C intervals) or as an alternative, supplement the SPECpower, SERT or EN 303 470 reports with such overview of system power use at different inlet temperature intervals (in 5Â°C intervals).', 'JRC Assessment Framework', 'A.2 Data\\tcentre\\tavailability\\tobjectives\\nThe availability objectives of a data centre can restrict such improvements due to the use of redundant infrastructure components and infrastructures necessary to respond the following circumstances: a) the user of the data centre will either set or demand a series of service level agreements (SLAs) based upon the criticality of their business case covering continuity and quality of power and environmental control provision, connectivity and security; b) the SLAs will reflect directly the appetite for risk that the user has and their ability or willingness to accept shutdowns for maintenance and repairs in the critical systems; c) data centres whose users can accept high levels of risk, scheduled shutdowns for maintenance and shutdowns for fault repair can reach very low design KPIs; d) data centres whose users cannot accept risk of failure and demand concurrent maintenance and inherent fault tolerance are limited by those SLAs to a higher design (and actual) KPI than those facilities described above. Infrastructure design solutions to provide increasing availability are described in a number of International Standards including the EN 50600 series. These solutions generally range from â\\x80\\x9csingle- path (no redundancy of components)â\\x80\\x9d to â\\x80\\x9cmulti-path (fault tolerant even during maintenance)â\\x80\\x9d. The power supply and distribution system provides an example of the relationship between absolute energy consumption (contribution to KPIs) and availability of service (level of SLA). Typically, IT equipment will be impacted by disruption of supply lasting longer than 10 ms and as a result, uninterruptible power supply (UPS) systems are generally used to support utility power grid systems unable to meet the IT equipment needs. IEC 62040-3 describes the topologies of UPS systems and, in general, the maximum efficiency for each technology reduces as the degree of protection increases. As a result, the availability architecture and the level of protection will dictate the contribution to KPIs which address energy consumption of the power supply and distribution system. Tolerance to faults and ensuring availability to meet SLAs are important factors in the energy consumption of data centre equipment and infrastructures including environmental control. The criticality level and redundancy employed to the power delivery, cooling, IT and IT support systems are key factors in the resource consumption, effectiveness or efficiency levels of the data centre. A.3 Data centre location Resource availability and consumption can be impacted by physical location. For example, free-cooling (compressor-less mechanical thermal management) is less effective for higher external temperatures. 10 Bibliography [1] IEC 62040-3, Uninterruptible power systems (UPS) â\\x80\\x94 Part 3: Method of specifying the performance and test requirements [2] EN 50600 series, Information technology â\\x80\\x94 Data centre facilities and infrastructures Price based on 11 pages', 'A.2', 'A', 'A non-compliance is not necessarily elevated to a nonconformity if, for example, it is identified and corrected by the environmental management system processes.

See \\x93Further development of software efficiency definitions\\x94 in section 11 of the Code of Conduct.', 'JRC Assessment Framework', 'A.2 Data\\tcentre\\tavailability\\tobjectives\\nThe availability objectives of a data centre can restrict such improvements due to the use of redundant infrastructure components and infrastructures necessary to respond the following circumstances: a) the user of the data centre will either set or demand a series of service level agreements (SLAs) based upon the criticality of their business case covering continuity and quality of power and environmental control provision, connectivity and security; b) the SLAs will reflect directly the appetite for risk that the user has and their ability or willingness to accept shutdowns for maintenance and repairs in the critical systems; c) data centres whose users can accept high levels of risk, scheduled shutdowns for maintenance and shutdowns for fault repair can reach very low design KPIs; d) data centres whose users cannot accept risk of failure and demand concurrent maintenance and inherent fault tolerance are limited by those SLAs to a higher design (and actual) KPI than those facilities described above. Infrastructure design solutions to provide increasing availability are described in a number of International Standards including the EN 50600 series. These solutions generally range from â\\x80\\x9csingle- path (no redundancy of components)â\\x80\\x9d to â\\x80\\x9cmulti-path (fault tolerant even during maintenance)â\\x80\\x9d. The power supply and distribution system provides an example of the relationship between absolute energy consumption (contribution to KPIs) and availability of service (level of SLA). Typically, IT equipment will be impacted by disruption of supply lasting longer than 10 ms and as a result, uninterruptible power supply (UPS) systems are generally used to support utility power grid systems unable to meet the IT equipment needs. IEC 62040-3 describes the topologies of UPS systems and, in general, the maximum efficiency for each technology reduces as the degree of protection increases. As a result, the availability architecture and the level of protection will dictate the contribution to KPIs which address energy consumption of the power supply and distribution system. Tolerance to faults and ensuring availability to meet SLAs are important factors in the energy consumption of data centre equipment and infrastructures including environmental control. The criticality level and redundancy employed to the power delivery, cooling, IT and IT support systems are key factors in the resource consumption, effectiveness or efficiency levels of the data centre. A.3 Data centre location Resource availability and consumption can be impacted by physical location. For example, free-cooling (compressor-less mechanical thermal management) is less effective for higher external temperatures. 10 Bibliography [1] IEC 62040-3, Uninterruptible power systems (UPS) â\\x80\\x94 Part 3: Method of specifying the performance and test requirements [2] EN 50600 series, Information technology â\\x80\\x94 Data centre facilities and infrastructures Price based on 11 pages', 'A.2', 'A', 'A non-compliance is not necessarily elevated to a nonconformity if, for example, it is identified and corrected by the environmental management system processes.

See \\x93Further development of software efficiency definitions\\x94 in section 11 of the Code of Conduct.', 'JRC Assessment Framework', 'A.2 Data\\tcentre\\tavailability\\tobjectives\\nThe availability objectives of a data centre can restrict such improvements due to the use of redundant infrastructure components and infrastructures necessary to respond the following circumstances: a) the user of the data centre will either set or demand a series of service level agreements (SLAs) based upon the criticality of their business case covering continuity and quality of power and environmental control provision, connectivity and security; b) the SLAs will reflect directly the appetite for risk that the user has and their ability or willingness to accept shutdowns for maintenance and repairs in the critical systems; c) data centres whose users can accept high levels of risk, scheduled shutdowns for maintenance and shutdowns for fault repair can reach very low design KPIs; d) data centres whose users cannot accept risk of failure and demand concurrent maintenance and inherent fault tolerance are limited by those SLAs to a higher design (and actual) KPI than those facilities described above. Infrastructure design solutions to provide increasing availability are described in a number of International Standards including the EN 50600 series. These solutions generally range from â\\x80\\x9csingle- path (no redundancy of components)â\\x80\\x9d to â\\x80\\x9cmulti-path (fault tolerant even during maintenance)â\\x80\\x9d. The power supply and distribution system provides an example of the relationship between absolute energy consumption (contribution to KPIs) and availability of service (level of SLA). Typically, IT equipment will be impacted by disruption of supply lasting longer than 10 ms and as a result, uninterruptible power supply (UPS) systems are generally used to support utility power grid systems unable to meet the IT equipment needs. IEC 62040-3 describes the topologies of UPS systems and, in general, the maximum efficiency for each technology reduces as the degree of protection increases. As a result, the availability architecture and the level of protection will dictate the contribution to KPIs which address energy consumption of the power supply and distribution system. Tolerance to faults and ensuring availability to meet SLAs are important factors in the energy consumption of data centre equipment and infrastructures including environmental control. The criticality level and redundancy employed to the power delivery, cooling, IT and IT support systems are key factors in the resource consumption, effectiveness or efficiency levels of the data centre. A.3 Data centre location Resource availability and consumption can be impacted by physical location. For example, free-cooling (compressor-less mechanical thermal management) is less effective for higher external temperatures. 10 Bibliography [1] IEC 62040-3, Uninterruptible power systems (UPS) â\\x80\\x94 Part 3: Method of specifying the performance and test requirements [2] EN 50600 series, Information technology â\\x80\\x94 Data centre facilities and infrastructures Price based on 11 pages', 'A.2', 'A', 'A non-compliance is not necessarily elevated to a nonconformity if, for example, it is identified and corrected by the environmental management system processes.

['A.2 Data\\tcentre\\tavailability\\tobjectives\\nThe availability objectives of a data centre can restrict such improvements due to the use of redundant infrastructure components and infrastructures necessary to respond the following circumstances: a) the user of the data centre will either set or demand a series of service level agreements (SLAs) based upon the criticality of their business case covering continuity and quality of power and environmental control provision, connectivity and security; b) the SLAs will reflect directly the appetite for risk that the user has and their ability or willingness to accept shutdowns for maintenance and repairs in the critical systems; c) data centres whose users can accept high levels of risk, scheduled shutdowns for maintenance and shutdowns for fault repair can reach very low design KPIs; d) data centres whose users cannot accept risk of failure and demand concurrent maintenance and inherent fault tolerance are limited by those SLAs to a higher design (and actual) KPI than those facilities described above. Infrastructure design solutions to provide increasing availability are described in a number of International Standards including the EN 50600 series. These solutions generally range from â\\x80\\x9csingle- path (no redundancy of components)â\\x80\\x9d to â\\x80\\x9cmulti-path (fault tolerant even during maintenance)â\\x80\\x9d. The power supply and distribution system provides an example of the relationship between absolute energy consumption (contribution to KPIs) and availability of service (level of SLA). Typically, IT equipment will be impacted by disruption of supply lasting longer than 10 ms and as a result, uninterruptible power supply (UPS) systems are generally used to support utility power grid systems unable to meet the IT equipment needs. IEC 62040-3 describes the topologies of UPS systems and, in general, the maximum efficiency for each technology reduces as the degree of protection increases. As a result, the availability architecture and the level of protection will dictate the contribution to KPIs which address energy consumption of the power supply and distribution system. Tolerance to faults and ensuring availability to meet SLAs are important factors in the energy consumption of data centre equipment and infrastructures including environmental control. The criticality level and redundancy employed to the power delivery, cooling, IT and IT support systems are key factors in the resource consumption, effectiveness or efficiency levels of the data centre. A.3 Data centre location Resource availability and consumption can be impacted by physical location. For example, free-cooling (compressor-less mechanical thermal management) is less effective for higher external temperatures. 10 Bibliography [1] IEC 62040-3, Uninterruptible power systems (UPS) â\\x80\\x94 Part 3: Method of specifying the performance and test requirements [2] EN 50600 series, Information technology â\\x80\\x94 Data centre facilities and infrastructures Price based on 11 pages', 'A.2', 'A', 'A non-compliance is not necessarily elevated to a nonconformity if, for example, it is identified and corrected by the environmental management system processes.

Infrastructure design solutions to provide increasing availability are described in a number of International Standards including the EN 50600 series. These solutions generally range from â\\x80\\x9csingle- path (no redundancy of components)â\\x80\\x9d to â\\x80\\x9cmulti-path (fault tolerant even during maintenance)â\\x80\\x9d. The power supply and distribution system provides an example of the relationship between absolute energy consumption (contribution to KPIs) and availability of service (level of SLA). Typically, IT equipment will be impacted by disruption of supply lasting longer than 10 ms and as a result, uninterruptible power supply (UPS) systems are generally used to support utility power grid systems unable to meet the IT equipment needs. IEC 62040-3 describes the topologies of UPS systems and, in general, the maximum efficiency for each technology reduces as the degree of protection increases. As a result, the availability architecture and the level of protection will dictate the contribution to KPIs which address energy consumption of the power supply and distribution system. Tolerance to faults and ensuring availability to meet SLAs are important factors in the energy consumption of data centre equipment and infrastructures including environmental control. The criticality level and redundancy employed to the power delivery, cooling, IT and IT support systems are key factors in the resource consumption, effectiveness or efficiency levels of the data centre. A.3 Data centre location Resource availability and consumption can be impacted by physical location. For example, free-cooling (compressor-less mechanical thermal management) is less effective for higher external temperatures. 10 Bibliography [1] IEC 62040-3, Uninterruptible power systems (UPS) â\\x80\\x94 Part 3: Method of specifying the performance and test requirements [2] EN 50600 series, Information technology â\\x80\\x94 Data centre facilities and infrastructures Price based on 11 pages', 'A.2', 'A', 'A non-compliance is not necessarily elevated to a nonconformity if, for example, it is identified and corrected by the environmental management system processes.

Infrastructure design solutions to provide increasing availability are described in a number of International Standards including the EN 50600 series. These solutions generally range from â\\x80\\x9csingle- path (no redundancy of components)â\\x80\\x9d to â\\x80\\x9cmulti-path (fault tolerant even during maintenance)â\\x80\\x9d. The power supply and distribution system provides an example of the relationship between absolute energy consumption (contribution to KPIs) and availability of service (level of SLA). Typically, IT equipment will be impacted by disruption of supply lasting longer than 10 ms and as a result, uninterruptible power supply (UPS) systems are generally used to support utility power grid systems unable to meet the IT equipment needs. IEC 62040-3 describes the topologies of UPS systems and, in general, the maximum efficiency for each technology reduces as the degree of protection increases. As a result, the availability architecture and the level of protection will dictate the contribution to KPIs which address energy consumption of the power supply and distribution system. Tolerance to faults and ensuring availability to meet SLAs are important factors in the energy consumption of data centre equipment and infrastructures including environmental control. The criticality level and redundancy employed to the power delivery, cooling, IT and IT support systems are key factors in the resource consumption, effectiveness or efficiency levels of the data centre. A.3 Data centre location Resource availability and consumption can be impacted by physical location. For example, free-cooling (compressor-less mechanical thermal management) is less effective for higher external temperatures. 10 Bibliography [1] IEC 62040-3, Uninterruptible power systems (UPS) â\\x80\\x94 Part 3: Method of specifying the performance and test requirements [2] EN 50600 series, Information technology â\\x80\\x94 Data centre facilities and infrastructures Price based on 11 pages', 'A.2', 'A', 'A non-compliance is not necessarily elevated to a nonconformity if, for example, it is identified and corrected by the environmental management system processes.

Infrastructure design solutions to provide increasing availability are described in a number of International Standards including the EN 50600 series. These solutions generally range from â\\x80\\x9csingle- path (no redundancy of components)â\\x80\\x9d to â\\x80\\x9cmulti-path (fault tolerant even during maintenance)â\\x80\\x9d. The power supply and distribution system provides an example of the relationship between absolute energy consumption (contribution to KPIs) and availability of service (level of SLA). Typically, IT equipment will be impacted by disruption of supply lasting longer than 10 ms and as a result, uninterruptible power supply (UPS) systems are generally used to support utility power grid systems unable to meet the IT equipment needs. IEC 62040-3 describes the topologies of UPS systems and, in general, the maximum efficiency for each technology reduces as the degree of protection increases. As a result, the availability architecture and the level of protection will dictate the contribution to KPIs which address energy consumption of the power supply and distribution system. Tolerance to faults and ensuring availability to meet SLAs are important factors in the energy consumption of data centre equipment and infrastructures including environmental control. The criticality level and redundancy employed to the power delivery, cooling, IT and IT support systems are key factors in the resource consumption, effectiveness or efficiency levels of the data centre. A.3 Data centre location Resource availability and consumption can be impacted by physical location. For example, free-cooling (compressor-less mechanical thermal management) is less effective for higher external temperatures. 10 Bibliography [1] IEC 62040-3, Uninterruptible power systems (UPS) â\\x80\\x94 Part 3: Method of specifying the performance and test requirements [2] EN 50600 series, Information technology â\\x80\\x94 Data centre facilities and infrastructures Price based on 11 pages', 'A.2', 'A', 'A non-compliance is not necessarily elevated to a nonconformity if, for example, it is identified and corrected by the environmental management system processes.

However, availability objectives and location can constrain the achievable improvements. There should be no â\\x80\\x9cjudgementâ\\x80\\x9d of an actual KPI without attaching to the data point a description of availability objectives and the location/climate of the data centre under consideration. KPIs should be used to help data centre managers to improve the data centreâ\\x80\\x99s resource usage effectiveness or efficiency by comparing and assessing improvement options.', 'A.1', 'A', 'A non-compliance is not necessarily elevated to a nonconformity if, for example, it is identified and corrected by the environmental management system processes. Compliance-related nonconformities need to be corrected, even if those nonconformities have not resulted in actual non-compliance with legal requirements.', 'Recommendation', 'ISO standards\\\\ISO_IEC_30134-1_2016(en).pdf', 'A.2 Data\\tcentre\\tavailability\\tobjectives\\nThe availability objectives of a data centre can restrict such improvements due to the use of redundant infrastructure components and infrastructures necessary to respond the following circumstances: a) the user of the data centre will either set or demand a series of service level agreements (SLAs) based upon the criticality of their business case covering continuity and quality of power and environmental control provision, connectivity and security; b) the SLAs will reflect directly the appetite for risk that the user has and their ability or willingness to accept shutdowns for maintenance and repairs in the critical systems; c) data centres whose users can accept high levels of risk, scheduled shutdowns for maintenance and shutdowns for fault repair can reach very low design KPIs; d) data centres whose users cannot accept risk of failure and demand concurrent maintenance and inherent fault tolerance are limited by those SLAs to a higher design (and actual) KPI than those facilities described above. Infrastructure design solutions to provide increasing availability are described in a number of International Standards including the EN 50600 series. These solutions generally range from â\\x80\\x9csingle- path (no redundancy of components)â\\x80\\x9d to â\\x80\\x9cmulti-path (fault tolerant even during maintenance)â\\x80\\x9d. The power supply and distribution system provides an example of the relationship between absolute energy consumption (contribution to KPIs) and availability of service (level of SLA). Typically, IT equipment will be impacted by disruption of supply lasting longer than 10 ms and as a result, uninterruptible power supply (UPS) systems are generally used to support utility power grid systems unable to meet the IT equipment needs. IEC 62040-3 describes the topologies of UPS systems and, in general, the maximum efficiency for each technology reduces as the degree of protection increases. As a result, the availability architecture and the level of protection will dictate the contribution to KPIs which address energy consumption of the power supply and distribution system. Tolerance to faults and ensuring availability to meet SLAs are important factors in the energy consumption of data centre equipment and infrastructures including environmental control. The criticality level and redundancy employed to the power delivery, cooling, IT and IT support systems are key factors in the resource consumption, effectiveness or efficiency levels of the data centre. A.3 Data centre location Resource availability and consumption can be impacted by physical location. For example, free-cooling (compressor-less mechanical thermal management) is less effective for higher external temperatures. 10 Bibliography [1] IEC 62040-3, Uninterruptible power systems (UPS) â\\x80\\x94 Part 3: Method of specifying the performance and test requirements [2] EN 50600 series, Information technology â\\x80\\x94 Data centre facilities and infrastructures Price based on 11 pages', 'A.2', 'A', 'A non-compliance is not necessarily elevated to a nonconformity if, for example, it is identified and corrected by the environmental management system processes.

However, availability objectives and location can constrain the achievable improvements. There should be no â\\x80\\x9cjudgementâ\\x80\\x9d of an actual KPI without attaching to the data point a description of availability objectives and the location/climate of the data centre under consideration. KPIs should be used to help data centre managers to improve the data centreâ\\x80\\x99s resource usage effectiveness or efficiency by comparing and assessing improvement options.', 'A.1', 'A', 'A non-compliance is not necessarily elevated to a nonconformity if, for example, it is identified and corrected by the environmental management system processes. Compliance-related nonconformities need to be corrected, even if those nonconformities have not resulted in actual non-compliance with legal requirements.', 'Recommendation', 'ISO standards\\\\ISO_IEC_30134-1_2016(en).pdf', 'A.2 Data\\tcentre\\tavailability\\tobjectives\\nThe availability objectives of a data centre can restrict such improvements due to the use of redundant infrastructure components and infrastructures necessary to respond the following circumstances: a) the user of the data centre will either set or demand a series of service level agreements (SLAs) based upon the criticality of their business case covering continuity and quality of power and environmental control provision, connectivity and security; b) the SLAs will reflect directly the appetite for risk that the user has and their ability or willingness to accept shutdowns for maintenance and repairs in the critical systems; c) data centres whose users can accept high levels of risk, scheduled shutdowns for maintenance and shutdowns for fault repair can reach very low design KPIs; d) data centres whose users cannot accept risk of failure and demand concurrent maintenance and inherent fault tolerance are limited by those SLAs to a higher design (and actual) KPI than those facilities described above. Infrastructure design solutions to provide increasing availability are described in a number of International Standards including the EN 50600 series. These solutions generally range from â\\x80\\x9csingle- path (no redundancy of components)â\\x80\\x9d to â\\x80\\x9cmulti-path (fault tolerant even during maintenance)â\\x80\\x9d. The power supply and distribution system provides an example of the relationship between absolute energy consumption (contribution to KPIs) and availability of service (level of SLA). Typically, IT equipment will be impacted by disruption of supply lasting longer than 10 ms and as a result, uninterruptible power supply (UPS) systems are generally used to support utility power grid systems unable to meet the IT equipment needs. IEC 62040-3 describes the topologies of UPS systems and, in general, the maximum efficiency for each technology reduces as the degree of protection increases. As a result, the availability architecture and the level of protection will dictate the contribution to KPIs which address energy consumption of the power supply and distribution system. Tolerance to faults and ensuring availability to meet SLAs are important factors in the energy consumption of data centre equipment and infrastructures including environmental control. The criticality level and redundancy employed to the power delivery, cooling, IT and IT support systems are key factors in the resource consumption, effectiveness or efficiency levels of the data centre. A.3 Data centre location Resource availability and consumption can be impacted by physical location. For example, free-cooling (compressor-less mechanical thermal management) is less effective for higher external temperatures. 10 Bibliography [1] IEC 62040-3, Uninterruptible power systems (UPS) â\\x80\\x94 Part 3: Method of specifying the performance and test requirements [2] EN 50600 series, Information technology â\\x80\\x94 Data centre facilities and infrastructures Price based on 11 pages', 'A.2', 'A', 'A non-compliance is not necessarily elevated to a nonconformity if, for example, it is identified and corrected by the environmental management system processes.

This report shall show the power consumption of the equipment at different utilization levels as well as in idling state.', 'JRC Assessment Framework', 'A.2 Data\\tcentre\\tavailability\\tobjectives\\nThe availability objectives of a data centre can restrict such improvements due to the use of redundant infrastructure components and infrastructures necessary to respond the following circumstances: a) the user of the data centre will either set or demand a series of service level agreements (SLAs) based upon the criticality of their business case covering continuity and quality of power and environmental control provision, connectivity and security; b) the SLAs will reflect directly the appetite for risk that the user has and their ability or willingness to accept shutdowns for maintenance and repairs in the critical systems; c) data centres whose users can accept high levels of risk, scheduled shutdowns for maintenance and shutdowns for fault repair can reach very low design KPIs; d) data centres whose users cannot accept risk of failure and demand concurrent maintenance and inherent fault tolerance are limited by those SLAs to a higher design (and actual) KPI than those facilities described above. Infrastructure design solutions to provide increasing availability are described in a number of International Standards including the EN 50600 series. These solutions generally range from â\\x80\\x9csingle- path (no redundancy of components)â\\x80\\x9d to â\\x80\\x9cmulti-path (fault tolerant even during maintenance)â\\x80\\x9d. The power supply and distribution system provides an example of the relationship between absolute energy consumption (contribution to KPIs) and availability of service (level of SLA). Typically, IT equipment will be impacted by disruption of supply lasting longer than 10 ms and as a result, uninterruptible power supply (UPS) systems are generally used to support utility power grid systems unable to meet the IT equipment needs. IEC 62040-3 describes the topologies of UPS systems and, in general, the maximum efficiency for each technology reduces as the degree of protection increases. As a result, the availability architecture and the level of protection will dictate the contribution to KPIs which address energy consumption of the power supply and distribution system. Tolerance to faults and ensuring availability to meet SLAs are important factors in the energy consumption of data centre equipment and infrastructures including environmental control. The criticality level and redundancy employed to the power delivery, cooling, IT and IT support systems are key factors in the resource consumption, effectiveness or efficiency levels of the data centre. A.3 Data centre location Resource availability and consumption can be impacted by physical location. For example, free-cooling (compressor-less mechanical thermal management) is less effective for higher external temperatures. 10 Bibliography [1] IEC 62040-3, Uninterruptible power systems (UPS) â\\x80\\x94 Part 3: Method of specifying the performance and test requirements [2] EN 50600 series, Information technology â\\x80\\x94 Data centre facilities and infrastructures Price based on 11 pages', 'A.2', 'A', 'A non-compliance is not necessarily elevated to a nonconformity if, for example, it is identified and corrected by the environmental management system processes.

Infrastructure design solutions to provide increasing availability are described in a number of International Standards including the EN 50600 series. These solutions generally range from â\\x80\\x9csingle- path (no redundancy of components)â\\x80\\x9d to â\\x80\\x9cmulti-path (fault tolerant even during maintenance)â\\x80\\x9d. The power supply and distribution system provides an example of the relationship between absolute energy consumption (contribution to KPIs) and availability of service (level of SLA). Typically, IT equipment will be impacted by disruption of supply lasting longer than 10 ms and as a result, uninterruptible power supply (UPS) systems are generally used to support utility power grid systems unable to meet the IT equipment needs. IEC 62040-3 describes the topologies of UPS systems and, in general, the maximum efficiency for each technology reduces as the degree of protection increases. As a result, the availability architecture and the level of protection will dictate the contribution to KPIs which address energy consumption of the power supply and distribution system. Tolerance to faults and ensuring availability to meet SLAs are important factors in the energy consumption of data centre equipment and infrastructures including environmental control. The criticality level and redundancy employed to the power delivery, cooling, IT and IT support systems are key factors in the resource consumption, effectiveness or efficiency levels of the data centre. A.3 Data centre location Resource availability and consumption can be impacted by physical location. For example, free-cooling (compressor-less mechanical thermal management) is less effective for higher external temperatures. 10 Bibliography [1] IEC 62040-3, Uninterruptible power systems (UPS) â\\x80\\x94 Part 3: Method of specifying the performance and test requirements [2] EN 50600 series, Information technology â\\x80\\x94 Data centre facilities and infrastructures Price based on 11 pages', 'A.2', 'A', 'A non-compliance is not necessarily elevated to a nonconformity if, for example, it is identified and corrected by the environmental management system processes.

['A.2 Data\\tcentre\\tavailability\\tobjectives\\nThe availability objectives of a data centre can restrict such improvements due to the use of redundant infrastructure components and infrastructures necessary to respond the following circumstances: a) the user of the data centre will either set or demand a series of service level agreements (SLAs) based upon the criticality of their business case covering continuity and quality of power and environmental control provision, connectivity and security; b) the SLAs will reflect directly the appetite for risk that the user has and their ability or willingness to accept shutdowns for maintenance and repairs in the critical systems; c) data centres whose users can accept high levels of risk, scheduled shutdowns for maintenance and shutdowns for fault repair can reach very low design KPIs; d) data centres whose users cannot accept risk of failure and demand concurrent maintenance and inherent fault tolerance are limited by those SLAs to a higher design (and actual) KPI than those facilities described above. Infrastructure design solutions to provide increasing availability are described in a number of International Standards including the EN 50600 series. These solutions generally range from â\\x80\\x9csingle- path (no redundancy of components)â\\x80\\x9d to â\\x80\\x9cmulti-path (fault tolerant even during maintenance)â\\x80\\x9d. The power supply and distribution system provides an example of the relationship between absolute energy consumption (contribution to KPIs) and availability of service (level of SLA). Typically, IT equipment will be impacted by disruption of supply lasting longer than 10 ms and as a result, uninterruptible power supply (UPS) systems are generally used to support utility power grid systems unable to meet the IT equipment needs. IEC 62040-3 describes the topologies of UPS systems and, in general, the maximum efficiency for each technology reduces as the degree of protection increases. As a result, the availability architecture and the level of protection will dictate the contribution to KPIs which address energy consumption of the power supply and distribution system. Tolerance to faults and ensuring availability to meet SLAs are important factors in the energy consumption of data centre equipment and infrastructures including environmental control. The criticality level and redundancy employed to the power delivery, cooling, IT and IT support systems are key factors in the resource consumption, effectiveness or efficiency levels of the data centre. A.3 Data centre location Resource availability and consumption can be impacted by physical location. For example, free-cooling (compressor-less mechanical thermal management) is less effective for higher external temperatures. 10 Bibliography [1] IEC 62040-3, Uninterruptible power systems (UPS) â\\x80\\x94 Part 3: Method of specifying the performance and test requirements [2] EN 50600 series, Information technology â\\x80\\x94 Data centre facilities and infrastructures Price based on 11 pages', 'A.2', 'A', 'A non-compliance is not necessarily elevated to a nonconformity if, for example, it is identified and corrected by the environmental management system processes.

['A.2 Data\\tcentre\\tavailability\\tobjectives\\nThe availability objectives of a data centre can restrict such improvements due to the use of redundant infrastructure components and infrastructures necessary to respond the following circumstances: a) the user of the data centre will either set or demand a series of service level agreements (SLAs) based upon the criticality of their business case covering continuity and quality of power and environmental control provision, connectivity and security; b) the SLAs will reflect directly the appetite for risk that the user has and their ability or willingness to accept shutdowns for maintenance and repairs in the critical systems; c) data centres whose users can accept high levels of risk, scheduled shutdowns for maintenance and shutdowns for fault repair can reach very low design KPIs; d) data centres whose users cannot accept risk of failure and demand concurrent maintenance and inherent fault tolerance are limited by those SLAs to a higher design (and actual) KPI than those facilities described above. Infrastructure design solutions to provide increasing availability are described in a number of International Standards including the EN 50600 series. These solutions generally range from â\\x80\\x9csingle- path (no redundancy of components)â\\x80\\x9d to â\\x80\\x9cmulti-path (fault tolerant even during maintenance)â\\x80\\x9d. The power supply and distribution system provides an example of the relationship between absolute energy consumption (contribution to KPIs) and availability of service (level of SLA). Typically, IT equipment will be impacted by disruption of supply lasting longer than 10 ms and as a result, uninterruptible power supply (UPS) systems are generally used to support utility power grid systems unable to meet the IT equipment needs. IEC 62040-3 describes the topologies of UPS systems and, in general, the maximum efficiency for each technology reduces as the degree of protection increases. As a result, the availability architecture and the level of protection will dictate the contribution to KPIs which address energy consumption of the power supply and distribution system. Tolerance to faults and ensuring availability to meet SLAs are important factors in the energy consumption of data centre equipment and infrastructures including environmental control. The criticality level and redundancy employed to the power delivery, cooling, IT and IT support systems are key factors in the resource consumption, effectiveness or efficiency levels of the data centre. A.3 Data centre location Resource availability and consumption can be impacted by physical location. For example, free-cooling (compressor-less mechanical thermal management) is less effective for higher external temperatures. 10 Bibliography [1] IEC 62040-3, Uninterruptible power systems (UPS) â\\x80\\x94 Part 3: Method of specifying the performance and test requirements [2] EN 50600 series, Information technology â\\x80\\x94 Data centre facilities and infrastructures Price based on 11 pages', 'A.2', 'A', 'A non-compliance is not necessarily elevated to a nonconformity if, for example, it is identified and corrected by the environmental management system processes.

Infrastructure design solutions to provide increasing availability are described in a number of International Standards including the EN 50600 series. These solutions generally range from â\\x80\\x9csingle- path (no redundancy of components)â\\x80\\x9d to â\\x80\\x9cmulti-path (fault tolerant even during maintenance)â\\x80\\x9d. The power supply and distribution system provides an example of the relationship between absolute energy consumption (contribution to KPIs) and availability of service (level of SLA). Typically, IT equipment will be impacted by disruption of supply lasting longer than 10 ms and as a result, uninterruptible power supply (UPS) systems are generally used to support utility power grid systems unable to meet the IT equipment needs. IEC 62040-3 describes the topologies of UPS systems and, in general, the maximum efficiency for each technology reduces as the degree of protection increases. As a result, the availability architecture and the level of protection will dictate the contribution to KPIs which address energy consumption of the power supply and distribution system. Tolerance to faults and ensuring availability to meet SLAs are important factors in the energy consumption of data centre equipment and infrastructures including environmental control. The criticality level and redundancy employed to the power delivery, cooling, IT and IT support systems are key factors in the resource consumption, effectiveness or efficiency levels of the data centre. A.3 Data centre location Resource availability and consumption can be impacted by physical location. For example, free-cooling (compressor-less mechanical thermal management) is less effective for higher external temperatures. 10 Bibliography [1] IEC 62040-3, Uninterruptible power systems (UPS) â\\x80\\x94 Part 3: Method of specifying the performance and test requirements [2] EN 50600 series, Information technology â\\x80\\x94 Data centre facilities and infrastructures Price based on 11 pages', 'A.2', 'A', 'A non-compliance is not necessarily elevated to a nonconformity if, for example, it is identified and corrected by the environmental management system processes.

['A.2 Data\\tcentre\\tavailability\\tobjectives\\nThe availability objectives of a data centre can restrict such improvements due to the use of redundant infrastructure components and infrastructures necessary to respond the following circumstances: a) the user of the data centre will either set or demand a series of service level agreements (SLAs) based upon the criticality of their business case covering continuity and quality of power and environmental control provision, connectivity and security; b) the SLAs will reflect directly the appetite for risk that the user has and their ability or willingness to accept shutdowns for maintenance and repairs in the critical systems; c) data centres whose users can accept high levels of risk, scheduled shutdowns for maintenance and shutdowns for fault repair can reach very low design KPIs; d) data centres whose users cannot accept risk of failure and demand concurrent maintenance and inherent fault tolerance are limited by those SLAs to a higher design (and actual) KPI than those facilities described above. Infrastructure design solutions to provide increasing availability are described in a number of International Standards including the EN 50600 series. These solutions generally range from â\\x80\\x9csingle- path (no redundancy of components)â\\x80\\x9d to â\\x80\\x9cmulti-path (fault tolerant even during maintenance)â\\x80\\x9d. The power supply and distribution system provides an example of the relationship between absolute energy consumption (contribution to KPIs) and availability of service (level of SLA). Typically, IT equipment will be impacted by disruption of supply lasting longer than 10 ms and as a result, uninterruptible power supply (UPS) systems are generally used to support utility power grid systems unable to meet the IT equipment needs. IEC 62040-3 describes the topologies of UPS systems and, in general, the maximum efficiency for each technology reduces as the degree of protection increases. As a result, the availability architecture and the level of protection will dictate the contribution to KPIs which address energy consumption of the power supply and distribution system. Tolerance to faults and ensuring availability to meet SLAs are important factors in the energy consumption of data centre equipment and infrastructures including environmental control. The criticality level and redundancy employed to the power delivery, cooling, IT and IT support systems are key factors in the resource consumption, effectiveness or efficiency levels of the data centre. A.3 Data centre location Resource availability and consumption can be impacted by physical location. For example, free-cooling (compressor-less mechanical thermal management) is less effective for higher external temperatures. 10 Bibliography [1] IEC 62040-3, Uninterruptible power systems (UPS) â\\x80\\x94 Part 3: Method of specifying the performance and test requirements [2] EN 50600 series, Information technology â\\x80\\x94 Data centre facilities and infrastructures Price based on 11 pages', 'A.2', 'A', 'A non-compliance is not necessarily elevated to a nonconformity if, for example, it is identified and corrected by the environmental management system processes.

['A.2 Data\\tcentre\\tavailability\\tobjectives\\nThe availability objectives of a data centre can restrict such improvements due to the use of redundant infrastructure components and infrastructures necessary to respond the following circumstances: a) the user of the data centre will either set or demand a series of service level agreements (SLAs) based upon the criticality of their business case covering continuity and quality of power and environmental control provision, connectivity and security; b) the SLAs will reflect directly the appetite for risk that the user has and their ability or willingness to accept shutdowns for maintenance and repairs in the critical systems; c) data centres whose users can accept high levels of risk, scheduled shutdowns for maintenance and shutdowns for fault repair can reach very low design KPIs; d) data centres whose users cannot accept risk of failure and demand concurrent maintenance and inherent fault tolerance are limited by those SLAs to a higher design (and actual) KPI than those facilities described above. Infrastructure design solutions to provide increasing availability are described in a number of International Standards including the EN 50600 series. These solutions generally range from â\\x80\\x9csingle- path (no redundancy of components)â\\x80\\x9d to â\\x80\\x9cmulti-path (fault tolerant even during maintenance)â\\x80\\x9d. The power supply and distribution system provides an example of the relationship between absolute energy consumption (contribution to KPIs) and availability of service (level of SLA). Typically, IT equipment will be impacted by disruption of supply lasting longer than 10 ms and as a result, uninterruptible power supply (UPS) systems are generally used to support utility power grid systems unable to meet the IT equipment needs. IEC 62040-3 describes the topologies of UPS systems and, in general, the maximum efficiency for each technology reduces as the degree of protection increases. As a result, the availability architecture and the level of protection will dictate the contribution to KPIs which address energy consumption of the power supply and distribution system. Tolerance to faults and ensuring availability to meet SLAs are important factors in the energy consumption of data centre equipment and infrastructures including environmental control. The criticality level and redundancy employed to the power delivery, cooling, IT and IT support systems are key factors in the resource consumption, effectiveness or efficiency levels of the data centre. A.3 Data centre location Resource availability and consumption can be impacted by physical location. For example, free-cooling (compressor-less mechanical thermal management) is less effective for higher external temperatures. 10 Bibliography [1] IEC 62040-3, Uninterruptible power systems (UPS) â\\x80\\x94 Part 3: Method of specifying the performance and test requirements [2] EN 50600 series, Information technology â\\x80\\x94 Data centre facilities and infrastructures Price based on 11 pages', 'A.2', 'A', 'A non-compliance is not necessarily elevated to a nonconformity if, for example, it is identified and corrected by the environmental management system processes.

Infrastructure design solutions to provide increasing availability are described in a number of International Standards including the EN 50600 series. These solutions generally range from â\\x80\\x9csingle- path (no redundancy of components)â\\x80\\x9d to â\\x80\\x9cmulti-path (fault tolerant even during maintenance)â\\x80\\x9d. The power supply and distribution system provides an example of the relationship between absolute energy consumption (contribution to KPIs) and availability of service (level of SLA). Typically, IT equipment will be impacted by disruption of supply lasting longer than 10 ms and as a result, uninterruptible power supply (UPS) systems are generally used to support utility power grid systems unable to meet the IT equipment needs. IEC 62040-3 describes the topologies of UPS systems and, in general, the maximum efficiency for each technology reduces as the degree of protection increases. As a result, the availability architecture and the level of protection will dictate the contribution to KPIs which address energy consumption of the power supply and distribution system. Tolerance to faults and ensuring availability to meet SLAs are important factors in the energy consumption of data centre equipment and infrastructures including environmental control. The criticality level and redundancy employed to the power delivery, cooling, IT and IT support systems are key factors in the resource consumption, effectiveness or efficiency levels of the data centre. A.3 Data centre location Resource availability and consumption can be impacted by physical location.

Infrastructure design solutions to provide increasing availability are described in a number of International Standards including the EN 50600 series. These solutions generally range from â\\x80\\x9csingle- path (no redundancy of components)â\\x80\\x9d to â\\x80\\x9cmulti-path (fault tolerant even during maintenance)â\\x80\\x9d. The power supply and distribution system provides an example of the relationship between absolute energy consumption (contribution to KPIs) and availability of service (level of SLA). Typically, IT equipment will be impacted by disruption of supply lasting longer than 10 ms and as a result, uninterruptible power supply (UPS) systems are generally used to support utility power grid systems unable to meet the IT equipment needs. IEC 62040-3 describes the topologies of UPS systems and, in general, the maximum efficiency for each technology reduces as the degree of protection increases. As a result, the availability architecture and the level of protection will dictate the contribution to KPIs which address energy consumption of the power supply and distribution system. Tolerance to faults and ensuring availability to meet SLAs are important factors in the energy consumption of data centre equipment and infrastructures including environmental control. The criticality level and redundancy employed to the power delivery, cooling, IT and IT support systems are key factors in the resource consumption, effectiveness or efficiency levels of the data centre. A.3 Data centre location Resource availability and consumption can be impacted by physical location. For example, free-cooling (compressor-less mechanical thermal management) is less effective for higher external temperatures. 10 Bibliography [1] IEC 62040-3, Uninterruptible power systems (UPS) â\\x80\\x94 Part 3: Method of specifying the performance and test requirements [2] EN 50600 series, Information technology â\\x80\\x94 Data centre facilities and infrastructures Price based on 11 pages', 'A.2', 'A', 'A non-compliance is not necessarily elevated to a nonconformity if, for example, it is identified and corrected by the environmental management system processes.

In determining its SEUs, the organization determines the criteria for what is substantial energy consumption and/or what is a considerable potential for energy performance improvement. SEUs can be defined depending on the needs of the organization, such as by facility (e.g. warehouse, factory, office), by process or system (e.g. lighting, steam, transport, electrolysis, motor- driven) or equipment (e.g. motor, boiler). Once identified, the management and control of SEUs are an integral part of the EnMS. Person(s) working under the control of the organization can include service contractors, part-time personnel and temporary staff. 22 Updating the energy review includes updating the data and information related to the analysis of energy use and energy consumption, determination of SEUs and identification of opportunities for improving energy performance. Not all parts of the energy review need to be updated at the same time. A formal energy audit can be used to assist in identifying opportunities for energy performance improvement in detail. An energy audit can provide information on one or more parts of the energy review. The scope of an energy audit can comprise a detailed review of the energy performance of an organization, SEU(s), systems, energy-using processes and/or equipment. It is typically based on appropriate measurement and observation of actual energy performance for the defined energy audit scope. Energy audit outputs typically include information on current energy consumption and energy performance, and they can be accompanied by a series of specific recommendations ranked by energy performance improvement or financial return on investment, based on analysis of specific site data and operating conditions. When looking for energy performance improvement opportunities, organizations should consider the extent to which energy is required for a particular process, or is recoverable. Even where a process such as a chemical reaction has limited improvement opportunities due to the energy requirements based on scientific laws, the auxiliary equipment can offer significant energy performance improvement potential, as can improved process control or equipment scheduling. Opportunities can also emerge over time due to changes in operating loads and parameters, equipment degradation and improvements in available technologies and techniques. Opportunities can also be identified in how equipment and systems are operated and maintained. The installation of a renewable energy type within the scope and boundaries of the EnMS, as defined by the organization, does not represent an energy performance improvement. Energy consumption across the boundary can decrease, however, there will be no measurable improvement in energy efficiency or energy consumption related to energy use as a result of the change. The consumption of renewable energy can have a positive environmental effect and other benefits and an organization can have an objective to increase its installation of renewable energy. In such cases, an organization needs to assess the renewable energy production separately. Where appropriate, an energy review can also consider security and availability of energy supply.', 'A.6.3', 'A.6', '', 'Recommendation', 'ISO standards\\\\ISO_50001_2018(en).pdf', 'CoC No: 3.2.12, Name: Monitor and manage air quality, Description: Ensure that air quality is monitored and managed to ensure that critical equipment is not damaged by particulates or corrosive elements which might impact both IT equipment and cooling equipment in terms of performance, energy efficiency and reliability.

['A.2 Data\\tcentre\\tavailability\\tobjectives\\nThe availability objectives of a data centre can restrict such improvements due to the use of redundant infrastructure components and infrastructures necessary to respond the following circumstances: a) the user of the data centre will either set or demand a series of service level agreements (SLAs) based upon the criticality of their business case covering continuity and quality of power and environmental control provision, connectivity and security; b) the SLAs will reflect directly the appetite for risk that the user has and their ability or willingness to accept shutdowns for maintenance and repairs in the critical systems; c) data centres whose users can accept high levels of risk, scheduled shutdowns for maintenance and shutdowns for fault repair can reach very low design KPIs; d) data centres whose users cannot accept risk of failure and demand concurrent maintenance and inherent fault tolerance are limited by those SLAs to a higher design (and actual) KPI than those facilities described above. Infrastructure design solutions to provide increasing availability are described in a number of International Standards including the EN 50600 series. These solutions generally range from â\\x80\\x9csingle- path (no redundancy of components)â\\x80\\x9d to â\\x80\\x9cmulti-path (fault tolerant even during maintenance)â\\x80\\x9d. The power supply and distribution system provides an example of the relationship between absolute energy consumption (contribution to KPIs) and availability of service (level of SLA). Typically, IT equipment will be impacted by disruption of supply lasting longer than 10 ms and as a result, uninterruptible power supply (UPS) systems are generally used to support utility power grid systems unable to meet the IT equipment needs. IEC 62040-3 describes the topologies of UPS systems and, in general, the maximum efficiency for each technology reduces as the degree of protection increases. As a result, the availability architecture and the level of protection will dictate the contribution to KPIs which address energy consumption of the power supply and distribution system. Tolerance to faults and ensuring availability to meet SLAs are important factors in the energy consumption of data centre equipment and infrastructures including environmental control. The criticality level and redundancy employed to the power delivery, cooling, IT and IT support systems are key factors in the resource consumption, effectiveness or efficiency levels of the data centre. A.3 Data centre location Resource availability and consumption can be impacted by physical location. For example, free-cooling (compressor-less mechanical thermal management) is less effective for higher external temperatures. 10 Bibliography [1] IEC 62040-3, Uninterruptible power systems (UPS) â\\x80\\x94 Part 3: Method of specifying the performance and test requirements [2] EN 50600 series, Information technology â\\x80\\x94 Data centre facilities and infrastructures Price based on 11 pages', 'A.2', 'A', 'A non-compliance is not necessarily elevated to a nonconformity if, for example, it is identified and corrected by the environmental management system processes.

['A.2 Data\\tcentre\\tavailability\\tobjectives\\nThe availability objectives of a data centre can restrict such improvements due to the use of redundant infrastructure components and infrastructures necessary to respond the following circumstances: a) the user of the data centre will either set or demand a series of service level agreements (SLAs) based upon the criticality of their business case covering continuity and quality of power and environmental control provision, connectivity and security; b) the SLAs will reflect directly the appetite for risk that the user has and their ability or willingness to accept shutdowns for maintenance and repairs in the critical systems; c) data centres whose users can accept high levels of risk, scheduled shutdowns for maintenance and shutdowns for fault repair can reach very low design KPIs; d) data centres whose users cannot accept risk of failure and demand concurrent maintenance and inherent fault tolerance are limited by those SLAs to a higher design (and actual) KPI than those facilities described above. Infrastructure design solutions to provide increasing availability are described in a number of International Standards including the EN 50600 series. These solutions generally range from â\\x80\\x9csingle- path (no redundancy of components)â\\x80\\x9d to â\\x80\\x9cmulti-path (fault tolerant even during maintenance)â\\x80\\x9d. The power supply and distribution system provides an example of the relationship between absolute energy consumption (contribution to KPIs) and availability of service (level of SLA). Typically, IT equipment will be impacted by disruption of supply lasting longer than 10 ms and as a result, uninterruptible power supply (UPS) systems are generally used to support utility power grid systems unable to meet the IT equipment needs. IEC 62040-3 describes the topologies of UPS systems and, in general, the maximum efficiency for each technology reduces as the degree of protection increases. As a result, the availability architecture and the level of protection will dictate the contribution to KPIs which address energy consumption of the power supply and distribution system. Tolerance to faults and ensuring availability to meet SLAs are important factors in the energy consumption of data centre equipment and infrastructures including environmental control. The criticality level and redundancy employed to the power delivery, cooling, IT and IT support systems are key factors in the resource consumption, effectiveness or efficiency levels of the data centre. A.3 Data centre location Resource availability and consumption can be impacted by physical location. For example, free-cooling (compressor-less mechanical thermal management) is less effective for higher external temperatures. 10 Bibliography [1] IEC 62040-3, Uninterruptible power systems (UPS) â\\x80\\x94 Part 3: Method of specifying the performance and test requirements [2] EN 50600 series, Information technology â\\x80\\x94 Data centre facilities and infrastructures Price based on 11 pages', 'A.2', 'A', 'A non-compliance is not necessarily elevated to a nonconformity if, for example, it is identified and corrected by the environmental management system processes.

In determining its SEUs, the organization determines the criteria for what is substantial energy consumption and/or what is a considerable potential for energy performance improvement. SEUs can be defined depending on the needs of the organization, such as by facility (e.g. warehouse, factory, office), by process or system (e.g. lighting, steam, transport, electrolysis, motor- driven) or equipment (e.g. motor, boiler). Once identified, the management and control of SEUs are an integral part of the EnMS. Person(s) working under the control of the organization can include service contractors, part-time personnel and temporary staff. 22 Updating the energy review includes updating the data and information related to the analysis of energy use and energy consumption, determination of SEUs and identification of opportunities for improving energy performance. Not all parts of the energy review need to be updated at the same time. A formal energy audit can be used to assist in identifying opportunities for energy performance improvement in detail. An energy audit can provide information on one or more parts of the energy review. The scope of an energy audit can comprise a detailed review of the energy performance of an organization, SEU(s), systems, energy-using processes and/or equipment. It is typically based on appropriate measurement and observation of actual energy performance for the defined energy audit scope. Energy audit outputs typically include information on current energy consumption and energy performance, and they can be accompanied by a series of specific recommendations ranked by energy performance improvement or financial return on investment, based on analysis of specific site data and operating conditions. When looking for energy performance improvement opportunities, organizations should consider the extent to which energy is required for a particular process, or is recoverable. Even where a process such as a chemical reaction has limited improvement opportunities due to the energy requirements based on scientific laws, the auxiliary equipment can offer significant energy performance improvement potential, as can improved process control or equipment scheduling. Opportunities can also emerge over time due to changes in operating loads and parameters, equipment degradation and improvements in available technologies and techniques. Opportunities can also be identified in how equipment and systems are operated and maintained. The installation of a renewable energy type within the scope and boundaries of the EnMS, as defined by the organization, does not represent an energy performance improvement. Energy consumption across the boundary can decrease, however, there will be no measurable improvement in energy efficiency or energy consumption related to energy use as a result of the change. The consumption of renewable energy can have a positive environmental effect and other benefits and an organization can have an objective to increase its installation of renewable energy. In such cases, an organization needs to assess the renewable energy production separately.

['A.2 Data\\tcentre\\tavailability\\tobjectives\\nThe availability objectives of a data centre can restrict such improvements due to the use of redundant infrastructure components and infrastructures necessary to respond the following circumstances: a) the user of the data centre will either set or demand a series of service level agreements (SLAs) based upon the criticality of their business case covering continuity and quality of power and environmental control provision, connectivity and security; b) the SLAs will reflect directly the appetite for risk that the user has and their ability or willingness to accept shutdowns for maintenance and repairs in the critical systems; c) data centres whose users can accept high levels of risk, scheduled shutdowns for maintenance and shutdowns for fault repair can reach very low design KPIs; d) data centres whose users cannot accept risk of failure and demand concurrent maintenance and inherent fault tolerance are limited by those SLAs to a higher design (and actual) KPI than those facilities described above. Infrastructure design solutions to provide increasing availability are described in a number of International Standards including the EN 50600 series. These solutions generally range from â\\x80\\x9csingle- path (no redundancy of components)â\\x80\\x9d to â\\x80\\x9cmulti-path (fault tolerant even during maintenance)â\\x80\\x9d. The power supply and distribution system provides an example of the relationship between absolute energy consumption (contribution to KPIs) and availability of service (level of SLA). Typically, IT equipment will be impacted by disruption of supply lasting longer than 10 ms and as a result, uninterruptible power supply (UPS) systems are generally used to support utility power grid systems unable to meet the IT equipment needs. IEC 62040-3 describes the topologies of UPS systems and, in general, the maximum efficiency for each technology reduces as the degree of protection increases. As a result, the availability architecture and the level of protection will dictate the contribution to KPIs which address energy consumption of the power supply and distribution system. Tolerance to faults and ensuring availability to meet SLAs are important factors in the energy consumption of data centre equipment and infrastructures including environmental control. The criticality level and redundancy employed to the power delivery, cooling, IT and IT support systems are key factors in the resource consumption, effectiveness or efficiency levels of the data centre. A.3 Data centre location Resource availability and consumption can be impacted by physical location. For example, free-cooling (compressor-less mechanical thermal management) is less effective for higher external temperatures. 10 Bibliography [1] IEC 62040-3, Uninterruptible power systems (UPS) â\\x80\\x94 Part 3: Method of specifying the performance and test requirements [2] EN 50600 series, Information technology â\\x80\\x94 Data centre facilities and infrastructures Price based on 11 pages', 'A.2', 'A', 'A non-compliance is not necessarily elevated to a nonconformity if, for example, it is identified and corrected by the environmental management system processes.

      "- Infrastructure includes fire detection and suppression systems, access control, and electronic security. ['A.2 Data\\tcentre\\tavailability\\tobjectives\\nThe availability objectives of a data centre can restrict such improvements due to the use of redundant infrastructure components and infrastructures necessary to respond the following circumstances: a) the user of the data centre will either set or demand a series of service level agreements (SLAs) based upon the criticality of their business case covering continuity and quality of power and environmental control provision, connectivity and security; b) the SLAs will reflect directly the appetite for risk that the user has and their ability or willingness to accept shutdowns for maintenance and repairs in the critical systems; c) data centres whose users can accept high levels of risk, scheduled shutdowns for maintenance and shutdowns for fault repair can reach very low design KPIs; d) data centres whose users cannot accept risk of failure and demand concurrent maintenance and inherent fault tolerance are limited by those SLAs to a higher design (and actual) KPI than those facilities described above. Infrastructure design solutions to provide increasing availability are described in a number of International Standards including the EN 50600 series. These solutions generally range from â\\x80\\x9csingle- path (no redundancy of components)â\\x80\\x9d to â\\x80\\x9cmulti-path (fault tolerant even during maintenance)â\\x80\\x9d. The power supply and distribution system provides an example of the relationship between absolute energy consumption (contribution to KPIs) and availability of service (level of SLA). Typically, IT equipment will be impacted by disruption of supply lasting longer than 10 ms and as a result, uninterruptible power supply (UPS) systems are generally used to support utility power grid systems unable to meet the IT equipment needs. IEC 62040-3 describes the topologies of UPS systems and, in general, the maximum efficiency for each technology reduces as the degree of protection increases. As a result, the availability architecture and the level of protection will dictate the contribution to KPIs which address energy consumption of the power supply and distribution system. Tolerance to faults and ensuring availability to meet SLAs are important factors in the energy consumption of data centre equipment and infrastructures including environmental control. The criticality level and redundancy employed to the power delivery, cooling, IT and IT support systems are key factors in the resource consumption, effectiveness or efficiency levels of the data centre. A.3 Data centre location Resource availability and consumption can be impacted by physical location. For example, free-cooling (compressor-less mechanical thermal management) is less effective for higher external temperatures. 10 Bibliography [1] IEC 62040-3, Uninterruptible power systems (UPS) â\\x80\\x94 Part 3: Method of specifying the performance and test requirements [2] EN 50600 series, Information technology â\\x80\\x94 Data centre facilities and infrastructures Price based on 11 pages', 'A.2', 'A', 'A non-compliance is not necessarily elevated to a nonconformity if, for example, it is identified and corrected by the environmental management system processes.

['A.2 Data\\tcentre\\tavailability\\tobjectives\\nThe availability objectives of a data centre can restrict such improvements due to the use of redundant infrastructure components and infrastructures necessary to respond the following circumstances: a) the user of the data centre will either set or demand a series of service level agreements (SLAs) based upon the criticality of their business case covering continuity and quality of power and environmental control provision, connectivity and security; b) the SLAs will reflect directly the appetite for risk that the user has and their ability or willingness to accept shutdowns for maintenance and repairs in the critical systems; c) data centres whose users can accept high levels of risk, scheduled shutdowns for maintenance and shutdowns for fault repair can reach very low design KPIs; d) data centres whose users cannot accept risk of failure and demand concurrent maintenance and inherent fault tolerance are limited by those SLAs to a higher design (and actual) KPI than those facilities described above. Infrastructure design solutions to provide increasing availability are described in a number of International Standards including the EN 50600 series. These solutions generally range from â\\x80\\x9csingle- path (no redundancy of components)â\\x80\\x9d to â\\x80\\x9cmulti-path (fault tolerant even during maintenance)â\\x80\\x9d. The power supply and distribution system provides an example of the relationship between absolute energy consumption (contribution to KPIs) and availability of service (level of SLA). Typically, IT equipment will be impacted by disruption of supply lasting longer than 10 ms and as a result, uninterruptible power supply (UPS) systems are generally used to support utility power grid systems unable to meet the IT equipment needs. IEC 62040-3 describes the topologies of UPS systems and, in general, the maximum efficiency for each technology reduces as the degree of protection increases. As a result, the availability architecture and the level of protection will dictate the contribution to KPIs which address energy consumption of the power supply and distribution system. Tolerance to faults and ensuring availability to meet SLAs are important factors in the energy consumption of data centre equipment and infrastructures including environmental control. The criticality level and redundancy employed to the power delivery, cooling, IT and IT support systems are key factors in the resource consumption, effectiveness or efficiency levels of the data centre. A.3 Data centre location Resource availability and consumption can be impacted by physical location. For example, free-cooling (compressor-less mechanical thermal management) is less effective for higher external temperatures. 10 Bibliography [1] IEC 62040-3, Uninterruptible power systems (UPS) â\\x80\\x94 Part 3: Method of specifying the performance and test requirements [2] EN 50600 series, Information technology â\\x80\\x94 Data centre facilities and infrastructures Price based on 11 pages', 'A.2', 'A', 'A non-compliance is not necessarily elevated to a nonconformity if, for example, it is identified and corrected by the environmental management system processes.

['A.2 Data\\tcentre\\tavailability\\tobjectives\\nThe availability objectives of a data centre can restrict such improvements due to the use of redundant infrastructure components and infrastructures necessary to respond the following circumstances: a) the user of the data centre will either set or demand a series of service level agreements (SLAs) based upon the criticality of their business case covering continuity and quality of power and environmental control provision, connectivity and security; b) the SLAs will reflect directly the appetite for risk that the user has and their ability or willingness to accept shutdowns for maintenance and repairs in the critical systems; c) data centres whose users can accept high levels of risk, scheduled shutdowns for maintenance and shutdowns for fault repair can reach very low design KPIs; d) data centres whose users cannot accept risk of failure and demand concurrent maintenance and inherent fault tolerance are limited by those SLAs to a higher design (and actual) KPI than those facilities described above. Infrastructure design solutions to provide increasing availability are described in a number of International Standards including the EN 50600 series. These solutions generally range from â\\x80\\x9csingle- path (no redundancy of components)â\\x80\\x9d to â\\x80\\x9cmulti-path (fault tolerant even during maintenance)â\\x80\\x9d. The power supply and distribution system provides an example of the relationship between absolute energy consumption (contribution to KPIs) and availability of service (level of SLA). Typically, IT equipment will be impacted by disruption of supply lasting longer than 10 ms and as a result, uninterruptible power supply (UPS) systems are generally used to support utility power grid systems unable to meet the IT equipment needs. IEC 62040-3 describes the topologies of UPS systems and, in general, the maximum efficiency for each technology reduces as the degree of protection increases. As a result, the availability architecture and the level of protection will dictate the contribution to KPIs which address energy consumption of the power supply and distribution system. Tolerance to faults and ensuring availability to meet SLAs are important factors in the energy consumption of data centre equipment and infrastructures including environmental control. The criticality level and redundancy employed to the power delivery, cooling, IT and IT support systems are key factors in the resource consumption, effectiveness or efficiency levels of the data centre. A.3 Data centre location Resource availability and consumption can be impacted by physical location. For example, free-cooling (compressor-less mechanical thermal management) is less effective for higher external temperatures. 10 Bibliography [1] IEC 62040-3, Uninterruptible power systems (UPS) â\\x80\\x94 Part 3: Method of specifying the performance and test requirements [2] EN 50600 series, Information technology â\\x80\\x94 Data centre facilities and infrastructures Price based on 11 pages', 'A.2', 'A', 'A non-compliance is not necessarily elevated to a nonconformity if, for example, it is identified and corrected by the environmental management system processes.

Planning for which data to collect, how to collect them and how often to collect them helps ensure the availability of the data needed to maintain the energy review and the monitoring, measurement, analysis and evaluation processes. Data can range from a simple numerical count up to complete monitoring and measurement systems connected to a software application capable of consolidating data and delivering automatic analysis.', 'A.6.6', 'A.6', '', 'General', 'ISO standards\\\\ISO_50001_2018(en).pdf', 'A.10 Improvement\\nâ\\x80\\x9cContinualâ\\x80\\x9d implies occurrence over a period of time, but can include intervals of interruption (unlike â\\x80\\x9ccontinuousâ\\x80\\x9d which indicates occurrence without interruption). In the context of continual improvement, the expectation is that improvements occur periodically, over time. The rate, extent and timescale of actions that support continual improvement are determined by the organization, in light of its context, economic factors and other circumstances. Energy performance improvement can be demonstrated in several ways, such as: a) reduction in normalized energy consumption for the scope and boundaries of the EnMS; b) progress toward the energy target(s) and management of the SEUs. It is recognized that improvements are achieved based on the priorities of the organization. Examples of continual energy performance improvement include, but are not limited to, the following. â\\x80\\x94 Total energy consumption decreases over time under similar conditions, e.g. a commercial building in a region where the temperature does not vary significantly. â\\x80\\x94 Total energy consumption increases, but the measure of energy performance as defined by the organization improves.

Energy performance improvement can be demonstrated by improvements in EnPI values over time, relative to the corresponding EnB. There can be situations where energy performance improvement is achieved from an activity that is not related to an SEU or key characteristic. In those instances, an EnPI and EnB can be established to demonstrate energy performance improvement. When conducting analysis, the limitations of the data (accuracy, precision, measurement uncertainty) and consistency of energy accounting should be taken into account before reaching final conclusions.', 'A.9.1', 'A.9', '', 'Recommendation', 'ISO standards\\\\ISO_50001_2018(en).pdf', 'A.6.3\\nEnergy review The process of identification of energy types and evaluation of energy use and energy consumption leads the organization to determine areas of significant energy use and identify opportunities for improving energy performance. In determining its SEUs, the organization determines the criteria for what is substantial energy consumption and/or what is a considerable potential for energy performance improvement. SEUs can be defined depending on the needs of the organization, such as by facility (e.g. warehouse, factory, office), by process or system (e.g. lighting, steam, transport, electrolysis, motor- driven) or equipment (e.g. motor, boiler). Once identified, the management and control of SEUs are an integral part of the EnMS. Person(s) working under the control of the organization can include service contractors, part-time personnel and temporary staff. 22 Updating the energy review includes updating the data and information related to the analysis of energy use and energy consumption, determination of SEUs and identification of opportunities for improving energy performance. Not all parts of the energy review need to be updated at the same time. A formal energy audit can be used to assist in identifying opportunities for energy performance improvement in detail. An energy audit can provide information on one or more parts of the energy review. The scope of an energy audit can comprise a detailed review of the energy performance of an organization, SEU(s), systems, energy-using processes and/or equipment. It is typically based on appropriate measurement and observation of actual energy performance for the defined energy audit scope. Energy audit outputs typically include information on current energy consumption and energy performance, and they can be accompanied by a series of specific recommendations ranked by energy performance improvement or financial return on investment, based on analysis of specific site data and operating conditions. When looking for energy performance improvement opportunities, organizations should consider the extent to which energy is required for a particular process, or is recoverable. Even where a process such as a chemical reaction has limited improvement opportunities due to the energy requirements based on scientific laws, the auxiliary equipment can offer significant energy performance improvement potential, as can improved process control or equipment scheduling. Opportunities can also emerge over time due to changes in operating loads and parameters, equipment degradation and improvements in available technologies and techniques. Opportunities can also be identified in how equipment and systems are operated and maintained. The installation of a renewable energy type within the scope and boundaries of the EnMS, as defined by the organization, does not represent an energy performance improvement. Energy consumption across the boundary can decrease, however, there will be no measurable improvement in energy efficiency or energy consumption related to energy use as a result of the change. The consumption of renewable energy can have a positive environmental effect and other benefits and an organization can have an objective to increase its installation of renewable energy. In such cases, an organization needs to assess the renewable energy production separately.
