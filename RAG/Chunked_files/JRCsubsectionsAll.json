Consider new or retrofit of Electrically Commutated (EC) motors which are significantly more energy efficient than traditional AC motors across a wide range of speeds. In addition to installing variable speed drives it is critical to include the ability to properly control the speed according to demand. It is of limited value to install drives which are manually set at a constant speed or have limited control settings.."
