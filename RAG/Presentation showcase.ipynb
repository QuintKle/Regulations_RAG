These requirements include a high level structure, identical core text, and common terms with core definitions, designed to benefit users implementing multiple ISO management system standards. This International Standard does not include requirements specific to other management systems, such as those for quality, occupational health and safety, energy or financial management. However, this International Standard enables an organization to use a common approach and risk-based thinking to integrate its environmental management system with the requirements of other management systems. This International Standard contains the requirements used to assess conformity. An organization that wishes to demonstrate conformity with this International Standard can do so by: — making a self-determination and self-declaration, or — seeking confirmation of its conformance by parties having an interest in the organization, such as customers, or — seeking confirmation of its self-declaration by a party external to the organization, or — seeking certification/registration of its environmental management system by an external organization. Annex A provides explanatory information to prevent misinterpretation of the requirements of this International Standard. Annex B shows broad technical correspondence between the previous edition of this International Standard and this edition. Implementation guidance on environmental management systems is included in ISO 14004. In this International Standard, the following verbal forms are used:— “shall” indicates a requirement; — “should” indicates a recommendation; — “may” indicates a permission; — “can” indicates a possibility or a capability.

There is, however, no requirement in this International Standard for its clause structure or terminology to be applied to an organization’s environmental management system documentation. There is no requirement to replace the terms used by an organization with the terms used in this International Standard. Organizations can choose to use terms that suit their business, e.g. “records”, “documentation”, or “protocols”, rather than “documented information”. 18 A.3 Clarification\\tof\\tconcepts In addition to the terms and definitions given in Clause 3, clarification of selected concepts is provided below to prevent misunderstanding. — In this International Standard, the use of the word “any” implies selection or choice. — The words “appropriate” and “applicable” are not interchangeable. “Appropriate” means suitable (for, to) and implies some degree of freedom, while “applicable” means relevant or possible to apply and implies that if it can be done, it needs to be done. — The word “consider” means it is necessary to think about the topic but it can be excluded; whereas “take into account” means it is necessary to think about the topic but it cannot be excluded. — “Continual” indicates duration that occurs over a period of time, but with intervals of interruption (unlike “continuous” which indicates duration without interruption). “Continual” is therefore the appropriate word to use when referring to improvement. — In this International Standard, the word “effect” is used to describe the result of a change to the organization. The phrase “environmental impact” refers specifically to the result of a change to the environment. — The word “ensure” means the responsibility can be delegated, but not the accountability. — This International Standard uses the term “interested party”; the term “stakeholder” is a synonym as it represents the same concept. This International Standard uses some new terminology. A brief explanation is given below to aid both new users and those who have used previous editions of this International Standard. — The phrase “compliance obligations” replaces the phrase “legal requirements and other requirements to which the organization subscribes” used in the previous edition of this International Standard. The intent of this new phrase does not differ from that of the previous edition. — “Documented information” replaces the nouns “documentation”, “documents” and “records” used in previous editions of this International Standard. To distinguish the intent of the generic term “documented information”, this International Standard now uses the phrase “retain documented information as evidence of....” to mean records, and “maintain documented information” to mean documentation other than records. The phrase “as evidence of….” is not a requirement to meet legal evidentiary requirements; its intent is only to indicate objective evidence needs to be retained. — The phrase “external provider” means an external supplier organization (including a contractor) that provides a product or a service. — The change from “identify” to “determine” is intended to harmonize with the standardized management system terminology. The word “determine” implies a discovery process that results in knowledge. The intent does not differ from that of previous editions. — The phrase “intended outcome” is what the organization intends to achieve by implementing its environmental management system. The minimal intended outcomes include enhancement of environmental performance, fulfilment of compliance obligations and achievement of environmental objectives. Organizations can set additional intended outcomes for their environmental management system. For example, consistent with their commitment to protection of the environment, an organization may establish an intended outcome to work towards sustainable development. — The phrase “person(s) doing work under its control” includes persons working for the organization and those working on its behalf for which the organization has responsibility (e.g. contractors). It replaces the phrase “persons working for it or on its behalf” and “persons working for or on behalf of the organization” used in the previous edition of this International Standard. The intent of this new phrase does not differ from that of the previous edition. — The concept of “target” used in previous editions of this International Standard is captured within the term “environmental objective”.

Infrastructure design solutions to provide increasing availability are described in a number of International Standards including the EN 50600 series. These solutions generally range from “single- path (no redundancy of components)” to “multi-path (fault tolerant even during maintenance)”. The power supply and distribution system provides an example of the relationship between absolute energy consumption (contribution to KPIs) and availability of service (level of SLA). Typically, IT equipment will be impacted by disruption of supply lasting longer than 10 ms and as a result, uninterruptible power supply (UPS) systems are generally used to support utility power grid systems unable to meet the IT equipment needs. IEC 62040-3 describes the topologies of UPS systems and, in general, the maximum efficiency for each technology reduces as the degree of protection increases. As a result, the availability architecture and the level of protection will dictate the contribution to KPIs which address energy consumption of the power supply and distribution system. Tolerance to faults and ensuring availability to meet SLAs are important factors in the energy consumption of data centre equipment and infrastructures including environmental control. The criticality level and redundancy employed to the power delivery, cooling, IT and IT support systems are key factors in the resource consumption, effectiveness or efficiency levels of the data centre. A.3 Data centre location Resource availability and consumption can be impacted by physical location. For example, free-cooling (compressor-less mechanical thermal management) is less effective for higher external temperatures. 10 Bibliography [1] IEC 62040-3, Uninterruptible power systems (UPS) — Part 3: Method of specifying the performance and test requirements [2] EN 50600 series, Information technology — Data centre facilities and infrastructures Price based on 11 pages', 'section_id': 'A.2', 'parent_id': 'A', 'parent_title': 'A non-compliance is not necessarily elevated to a nonconformity if, for example, it is identified and corrected by the environmental management system processes.

The EnMS utilizes interrelated elements such as energy performance indicators (EnPIs) and energy baselines (EnBs) as a means to demonstrate measurable improvements in energy efficiency or energy consumption, related to energy use (see Figure A.1). Figure A.1 — Relationship between energy performance and EnMS While this document requires demonstration of energy performance improvement, it is the organization that defines its energy performance and energy targets as well as how energy performance improvement will be demonstrated. A.3 Clarification\\tof\\tterminology The clause structure and some of the terminology of this document have been changed from the previous edition to improve alignment with other management system standards. There is, however, no requirement in this document for its clause structure or terminology to be applied to an organization’s EnMS documentation. There is no requirement to replace the terms used by an organization with the terms used in this document. Organizations can choose to use terms that suit their business and needs, or to use those found in this document. — In this document, the use of the word “any” implies selection or choice. — The words “appropriate” and “applicable” are not interchangeable. “Appropriate” means suitable (for, to) and implies some degree of freedom, while “applicable” means relevant or possible to apply and implies that if it can be done, it needs to be done. — The word “consider” means it is necessary to think about the topic but it can be excluded, whereas “take into account” means it is necessary to think about the topic but it cannot be excluded. — The word “ensure” means the responsibility can be delegated, but not the accountability. — This document uses the term “interested party”; the term “stakeholder” is a synonym as it represents the same concept. This edition uses some new terminology. A brief explanation is given below. As part of the alignment with other management system standards, a common clause on documented information has been adopted without significant change or addition (see 7.5). Consequently, the terms “documented procedure” and “record” have both been replaced throughout the text by “documented information”. — “Documented information” replaces the nouns “documentation”, “documents” and “records” used in previous editions of this document. To distinguish the intent of the generic term “documented information”, this document now uses the phrase “retain documented information...” to mean records, and “maintain documented information” to mean documentation other than records that is kept up to date. — The phrase “intended outcome” is what the organization intends to achieve by implementing its EnMS and working toward improved energy performance. — The phrase “person(s) doing work under its control” includes persons working for the organization and those working on its behalf for which the organization has responsibility (e.g. contractors, service providers). It replaces the phrase “persons working for it or on its behalf” and “persons working for or on behalf of the organization” used in the previous edition of this document. The intent of this new phrase does not differ from that of the previous edition.

In the context of continual improvement, the expectation is that improvements occur periodically, over time. The rate, extent and timescale of actions that support continual improvement are determined by the organization, in light of its context, economic factors and other circumstances. Energy performance improvement can be demonstrated in several ways, such as: a) reduction in normalized energy consumption for the scope and boundaries of the EnMS; b) progress toward the energy target(s) and management of the SEUs. It is recognized that improvements are achieved based on the priorities of the organization. Examples of continual energy performance improvement include, but are not limited to, the following. — Total energy consumption decreases over time under similar conditions, e.g. a commercial building in a region where the temperature does not vary significantly. — Total energy consumption increases, but the measure of energy performance as defined by the organization improves. In this case, a simple ratio where there is one relevant variable and no baseload. — Equipment has a predicted reduction in energy performance as it ages. A delay or reduction in the performance reduction curve due to proper operational and maintenance controls can demonstrate improved energy performance as defined by the organizational EnPIs. — In resource extraction industries where energy performance tends to decline as resources are depleted, e.g. in a mining facility where the depth and production both vary, reducing the rate of decline relative to the EnB can be considered a performance improvement. — In most situations and organizations, there are multiple relevant variables requiring normalization, e.g. a dairy producing three different products (milk, cheese, yogurt) and affected by weather. 26 © ISO 2018 – All rights reserved', 'section_id': 'A.10', 'parent_id': 'A', 'parent_title': 'A non-compliance is not necessarily elevated to a nonconformity if, for example, it is identified and corrected by the environmental management system processes.

The organization can ensure this by determining its risks and opportunities that need to be addressed and planning action to address them. These risks and opportunities can be related to environmental aspects, compliance obligations, other issues or other needs and expectations of interested parties. Environmental aspects (see 6.1.2 ) can create risks and opportunities associated with adverse environmental impacts, beneficial environmental impacts, and other effects on the organization. The risks and opportunities related to environmental aspects can be determined as part of the significance evaluation or determined separately. Compliance obligations (see 6.1.3 ) can create risks and opportunities, such as failing to comply (which can damage the organization’s reputation or result in legal action) or performing beyond its compliance obligations (which can enhance the organization’s reputation). 22 The organization can also have risks and opportunities related to other issues, including environmental conditions or needs and expectations of interested parties, which can affect the organization’s ability to achieve the intended outcomes of its environmental management system, e.g. a) environmental spillage due to literacy or language barriers among workers who cannot understand local work procedures; b) increased flooding due to climate change that could affect the organizations premises; c) lack of available resources to maintain an effective environmental management system due to economic constraints; d) introducing new technology financed by governmental grants, which could improve air quality; e) water scarcity during periods of drought that could affect the organization’s ability to operate its emission control equipment. Emergency situations are unplanned or unexpected events that need the urgent application of specific competencies, resources or processes to prevent or mitigate their actual or potential consequences. Emergency situations can result in adverse environmental impacts or other effects on the organization. When determining potential emergency situations (e.g. fire, chemical spill, severe weather), the organization should consider: — the nature of onsite hazards (e.g. flammable liquids, storage tanks, compressed gasses); — the most likely type and scale of an emergency situation; — the potential for emergency situations at a nearby facility (e.g. plant, road, railway line). Although risks and opportunities need to be determined and addressed, there is no requirement for formal risk management or a documented risk management process. It is up to the organization to select the method it will use to determine its risks and opportunities. The method may involve a simple qualitative process or a full quantitative assessment depending on the context in which the organization operates. The risks and opportunities identified (see 6.1.1 to 6.1.3 ) are inputs for planning actions (see 6.1.4 ) and for establishing the environmental objectives (see 6.2 ).', 'section_id': 'A.6.1.1', 'parent_id': 'A.6.1', 'parent_title': '', 'requirement_tag': 'Recommendation', 'source': 'ISO standards\\\\ISO_14001_2015(en).pdf'}, vector=None, shard_key=None, order_value=None),\n",

The environmental policy enables the organization to set its environmental objectives (see 6.2), take actions to achieve the intended outcomes of the environmental management system, and achieve continual improvement (see Clause 10). Three basic commitments for the environmental policy are specified in this International Standard to: a) protect the environment; b) fulfil the organization’s compliance obligations; c) continually improve the environmental management system to enhance environmental performance. These commitments are then reflected in the processes an organization establishes to address specific requirements in this International Standard, to ensure a robust, credible and reliable environmental management system. The commitment to protect the environment is intended to not only prevent adverse environmental impacts through prevention of pollution, but to protect the natural environment from harm and degradation arising from the organization’s activities, products and services. The specific commitment(s) an organization pursues should be relevant to the context of the organization, including the local or regional environmental conditions. These commitments can address, for example, water quality, recycling, or air quality, and can also include commitments related to climate change mitigation and adaptation, protection of biodiversity and ecosystems, and restoration. While all the commitments are important, some interested parties are especially concerned with the organization’s commitment to fulfil its compliance obligations, particularly applicable legal requirements.

In determining its SEUs, the organization determines the criteria for what is substantial energy consumption and/or what is a considerable potential for energy performance improvement. SEUs can be defined depending on the needs of the organization, such as by facility (e.g. warehouse, factory, office), by process or system (e.g. lighting, steam, transport, electrolysis, motor- driven) or equipment (e.g. motor, boiler). Once identified, the management and control of SEUs are an integral part of the EnMS. Person(s) working under the control of the organization can include service contractors, part-time personnel and temporary staff. 22 Updating the energy review includes updating the data and information related to the analysis of energy use and energy consumption, determination of SEUs and identification of opportunities for improving energy performance. Not all parts of the energy review need to be updated at the same time. A formal energy audit can be used to assist in identifying opportunities for energy performance improvement in detail. An energy audit can provide information on one or more parts of the energy review. The scope of an energy audit can comprise a detailed review of the energy performance of an organization, SEU(s), systems, energy-using processes and/or equipment. It is typically based on appropriate measurement and observation of actual energy performance for the defined energy audit scope. Energy audit outputs typically include information on current energy consumption and energy performance, and they can be accompanied by a series of specific recommendations ranked by energy performance improvement or financial return on investment, based on analysis of specific site data and operating conditions. When looking for energy performance improvement opportunities, organizations should consider the extent to which energy is required for a particular process, or is recoverable. Even where a process such as a chemical reaction has limited improvement opportunities due to the energy requirements based on scientific laws, the auxiliary equipment can offer significant energy performance improvement potential, as can improved process control or equipment scheduling. Opportunities can also emerge over time due to changes in operating loads and parameters, equipment degradation and improvements in available technologies and techniques. Opportunities can also be identified in how equipment and systems are operated and maintained. The installation of a renewable energy type within the scope and boundaries of the EnMS, as defined by the organization, does not represent an energy performance improvement. Energy consumption across the boundary can decrease, however, there will be no measurable improvement in energy efficiency or energy consumption related to energy use as a result of the change. The consumption of renewable energy can have a positive environmental effect and other benefits and an organization can have an objective to increase its installation of renewable energy. In such cases, an organization needs to assess the renewable energy production separately.

Changes to the environment, either adverse or beneficial, that result wholly or partially from environmental aspects are called environmental impacts. The environmental impact can occur at local, regional and global scales, and also can be direct, indirect or cumulative by nature. The relationship between environmental aspects and environmental impacts is one of cause and effect. When determining environmental aspects, the organization considers a life cycle perspective. This does not require a detailed life cycle assessment; thinking carefully about the life cycle stages that can be controlled or influenced by the organization is sufficient. Typical stages of a product (or service) life cycle include raw material acquisition, design, production, transportation/delivery, use, end-of-life treatment and final disposal. The life cycle stages that are applicable will vary depending on the activity, product or service. An organization needs to determine the environmental aspects within the scope of its environmental management system. It takes into account the inputs and outputs (both intended and unintended) that are associated with its current and relevant past activities, products and services; planned or new developments; and new or modified activities, products and services. The method used should consider normal and abnormal operating conditions, shut-down and start-up conditions, as well as the reasonably foreseeable emergency situations identified in 6.1.1 . Attention should be paid to prior occurrences of emergency situations. For information on environmental aspects as part of managing change, see Clause A.1 . An organization does not have to consider each product, component or raw material individually to determine and evaluate their environmental aspects; it may group or categorize activities, products and services when they have common characteristics. When determining its environmental aspects, the organization can consider:a) emissions to air; b) releases to water; c) releases to land; d) use of raw materials and natural resources; e) use of energy; f) energy emitted (e.g. heat, radiation, vibration (noise), light); g) generation of waste and/or by-products; h) use of space. In addition to the environmental aspects that it can control directly, an organization determines whether there are environmental aspects that it can influence. These can be related to products and services used by the organization which are provided by others, as well as products and services that it provides to others, including those associated with (an) outsourced process(es). With respect to those an organization provides to others, it can have limited influence on the use and end-of-life treatment of the products and services. In all circumstances, however, it is the organization that determines the extent of control it is able to exercise, the environmental aspects it can influence, and the extent to which it chooses to exercise such influence. Consideration should be given to environmental aspects related to the organization’s activities, products and services, such as: — design and development of its facilities, processes, products and services; — acquisition of raw materials, including extraction; — operational or manufacturing processes, including warehousing; — operation and maintenance of facilities, organizational assets and infrastructure; — environmental performance and practices of external providers; — product transportation and service delivery, including packaging; — storage, use and end-of-life treatment of products; — waste management, including reuse, refurbishing, recycling and disposal. There is no single method for determining significant environmental aspects, however, the method and criteria used should provide consistent results. The organization sets the criteria for determining its significant environmental aspects. Environmental criteria are the primary and minimum criteria for assessing environmental aspects. Criteria can relate to the environmental aspect (e.g. type, size, frequency) or the environmental impact (e.g. scale, severity, duration, exposure). Other criteria may also be used. An environmental aspect might not be significant when only considering environmental criteria. It can, however, reach or exceed the threshold for determining significance when other criteria are considered. These other criteria can include organizational issues, such as legal requirements or interested party concerns. These other criteria are not intended to be used to downgrade an aspect that is significant based on its environmental impact. 24 A significant environmental aspect can result in one or more significant environmental impacts, and can therefore result in risks and opportunities that need to be addressed to ensure the organization can achieve the intended outcomes of its environmental management system.', 'section_id': 'A.6.1.2', 'parent_id': 'A.6.1', 'parent_title': '', 'requirement_tag': 'Recommendation', 'source': 'ISO standards\\\\ISO_14001_2015(en).pdf'}, vector=None, shard_key=None, order_value=None),\n",

The KPIs specified in the ISO/IEC 30134 series do not take into account, or make judgement upon, the needs for such resilience.

Infrastructure design solutions to provide increasing availability are described in a number of International Standards including the EN 50600 series. These solutions generally range from “single- path (no redundancy of components)” to “multi-path (fault tolerant even during maintenance)”. The power supply and distribution system provides an example of the relationship between absolute energy consumption (contribution to KPIs) and availability of service (level of SLA). Typically, IT equipment will be impacted by disruption of supply lasting longer than 10 ms and as a result, uninterruptible power supply (UPS) systems are generally used to support utility power grid systems unable to meet the IT equipment needs. IEC 62040-3 describes the topologies of UPS systems and, in general, the maximum efficiency for each technology reduces as the degree of protection increases. As a result, the availability architecture and the level of protection will dictate the contribution to KPIs which address energy consumption of the power supply and distribution system. Tolerance to faults and ensuring availability to meet SLAs are important factors in the energy consumption of data centre equipment and infrastructures including environmental control. The criticality level and redundancy employed to the power delivery, cooling, IT and IT support systems are key factors in the resource consumption, effectiveness or efficiency levels of the data centre. A.3 Data centre location Resource availability and consumption can be impacted by physical location. For example, free-cooling (compressor-less mechanical thermal management) is less effective for higher external temperatures. 10 Bibliography [1] IEC 62040-3, Uninterruptible power systems (UPS) — Part 3: Method of specifying the performance and test requirements [2] EN 50600 series, Information technology — Data centre facilities and infrastructures Price based on 11 pages', 'section_id': 'A.2', 'parent_id': 'A', 'parent_title': 'A non-compliance is not necessarily elevated to a nonconformity if, for example, it is identified and corrected by the environmental management system processes.

Figure A.1 — Relationship between energy performance and EnMS While this document requires demonstration of energy performance improvement, it is the organization that defines its energy performance and energy targets as well as how energy performance improvement will be demonstrated. A.3 Clarification\\tof\\tterminology The clause structure and some of the terminology of this document have been changed from the previous edition to improve alignment with other management system standards. There is, however, no requirement in this document for its clause structure or terminology to be applied to an organization’s EnMS documentation. There is no requirement to replace the terms used by an organization with the terms used in this document. Organizations can choose to use terms that suit their business and needs, or to use those found in this document. — In this document, the use of the word “any” implies selection or choice. — The words “appropriate” and “applicable” are not interchangeable. “Appropriate” means suitable (for, to) and implies some degree of freedom, while “applicable” means relevant or possible to apply and implies that if it can be done, it needs to be done. — The word “consider” means it is necessary to think about the topic but it can be excluded, whereas “take into account” means it is necessary to think about the topic but it cannot be excluded. — The word “ensure” means the responsibility can be delegated, but not the accountability. — This document uses the term “interested party”; the term “stakeholder” is a synonym as it represents the same concept. This edition uses some new terminology. A brief explanation is given below. As part of the alignment with other management system standards, a common clause on documented information has been adopted without significant change or addition (see 7.5). Consequently, the terms “documented procedure” and “record” have both been replaced throughout the text by “documented information”. — “Documented information” replaces the nouns “documentation”, “documents” and “records” used in previous editions of this document. To distinguish the intent of the generic term “documented information”, this document now uses the phrase “retain documented information...” to mean records, and “maintain documented information” to mean documentation other than records that is kept up to date. — The phrase “intended outcome” is what the organization intends to achieve by implementing its EnMS and working toward improved energy performance. — The phrase “person(s) doing work under its control” includes persons working for the organization and those working on its behalf for which the organization has responsibility (e.g. contractors, service providers). It replaces the phrase “persons working for it or on its behalf” and “persons working for or on behalf of the organization” used in the previous edition of this document.

Organizations can choose to use terms that suit their business, e.g. “records”, “documentation”, or “protocols”, rather than “documented information”. 18 A.3 Clarification\\tof\\tconcepts In addition to the terms and definitions given in Clause 3, clarification of selected concepts is provided below to prevent misunderstanding. — In this International Standard, the use of the word “any” implies selection or choice. — The words “appropriate” and “applicable” are not interchangeable. “Appropriate” means suitable (for, to) and implies some degree of freedom, while “applicable” means relevant or possible to apply and implies that if it can be done, it needs to be done. — The word “consider” means it is necessary to think about the topic but it can be excluded; whereas “take into account” means it is necessary to think about the topic but it cannot be excluded. — “Continual” indicates duration that occurs over a period of time, but with intervals of interruption (unlike “continuous” which indicates duration without interruption). “Continual” is therefore the appropriate word to use when referring to improvement. — In this International Standard, the word “effect” is used to describe the result of a change to the organization. The phrase “environmental impact” refers specifically to the result of a change to the environment. — The word “ensure” means the responsibility can be delegated, but not the accountability. — This International Standard uses the term “interested party”; the term “stakeholder” is a synonym as it represents the same concept. This International Standard uses some new terminology. A brief explanation is given below to aid both new users and those who have used previous editions of this International Standard. — The phrase “compliance obligations” replaces the phrase “legal requirements and other requirements to which the organization subscribes” used in the previous edition of this International Standard. The intent of this new phrase does not differ from that of the previous edition. — “Documented information” replaces the nouns “documentation”, “documents” and “records” used in previous editions of this International Standard. To distinguish the intent of the generic term “documented information”, this International Standard now uses the phrase “retain documented information as evidence of....” to mean records, and “maintain documented information” to mean documentation other than records. The phrase “as evidence of….” is not a requirement to meet legal evidentiary requirements; its intent is only to indicate objective evidence needs to be retained. — The phrase “external provider” means an external supplier organization (including a contractor) that provides a product or a service. — The change from “identify” to “determine” is intended to harmonize with the standardized management system terminology. The word “determine” implies a discovery process that results in knowledge. The intent does not differ from that of previous editions. — The phrase “intended outcome” is what the organization intends to achieve by implementing its environmental management system. The minimal intended outcomes include enhancement of environmental performance, fulfilment of compliance obligations and achievement of environmental objectives. Organizations can set additional intended outcomes for their environmental management system. For example, consistent with their commitment to protection of the environment, an organization may establish an intended outcome to work towards sustainable development. — The phrase “person(s) doing work under its control” includes persons working for the organization and those working on its behalf for which the organization has responsibility (e.g. contractors). It replaces the phrase “persons working for it or on its behalf” and “persons working for or on behalf of the organization” used in the previous edition of this International Standard. The intent of this new phrase does not differ from that of the previous edition. — The concept of “target” used in previous editions of this International Standard is captured within the term “environmental objective”.

These impressions or views can be positive or negative. In the latter case (e.g. complaints), it is important that a prompt and clear answer is provided by the organization. A subsequent analysis of these complaints can provide valuable information for detecting improvement opportunities for the environmental management system. Communication should:a) be transparent, i.e. the organization is open in the way it derives what it has reported on; b) be appropriate, so that information meets the needs of relevant interested parties, enabling them to participate; c) be truthful and not misleading to those who rely on the information reported; d) be factual, accurate and able to be trusted; e) not exclude relevant information; f) be understandable to interested parties.

In the context of continual improvement, the expectation is that improvements occur periodically, over time. The rate, extent and timescale of actions that support continual improvement are determined by the organization, in light of its context, economic factors and other circumstances. Energy performance improvement can be demonstrated in several ways, such as: a) reduction in normalized energy consumption for the scope and boundaries of the EnMS; b) progress toward the energy target(s) and management of the SEUs. It is recognized that improvements are achieved based on the priorities of the organization. Examples of continual energy performance improvement include, but are not limited to, the following. — Total energy consumption decreases over time under similar conditions, e.g. a commercial building in a region where the temperature does not vary significantly. — Total energy consumption increases, but the measure of energy performance as defined by the organization improves. In this case, a simple ratio where there is one relevant variable and no baseload. — Equipment has a predicted reduction in energy performance as it ages. A delay or reduction in the performance reduction curve due to proper operational and maintenance controls can demonstrate improved energy performance as defined by the organizational EnPIs. — In resource extraction industries where energy performance tends to decline as resources are depleted, e.g. in a mining facility where the depth and production both vary, reducing the rate of decline relative to the EnB can be considered a performance improvement. — In most situations and organizations, there are multiple relevant variables requiring normalization, e.g. a dairy producing three different products (milk, cheese, yogurt) and affected by weather. 26 © ISO 2018 – All rights reserved', 'section_id': 'A.10', 'parent_id': 'A', 'parent_title': 'A non-compliance is not necessarily elevated to a nonconformity if, for example, it is identified and corrected by the environmental management system processes.
