Sustainable development as a goal is achieved by balancing the three pillars of sustainability. Societal expectations for sustainable development, transparency and accountability have evolved with increasingly stringent legislation, growing pressures on the environment from pollution, inefficient use of resources, improper waste management, climate change, degradation of ecosystems and loss of biodiversity. This has led organizations to adopt a systematic approach to environmental management by implementing environmental management systems with the aim of contributing to the environmental pillar of sustainability.', '0.2': '0.2\\nAim of an environmental management system The purpose of this International Standard is to provide organizations with a framework to protect the environment and respond to changing environmental conditions in balance with socio-economic needs. It specifies requirements that enable an organization to achieve the intended outcomes it sets for its environmental management system.', 'A': 'A non-compliance is not necessarily elevated to a nonconformity if, for example, it is identified and corrected by the environmental management system processes. Compliance-related nonconformities need to be corrected, even if those nonconformities have not resulted in actual non-compliance with legal requirements.', '0.3': '0.3\\nSuccess factors The success of an environmental management system depends on commitment from all levels and functions of the organization, led by top management. Organizations can leverage opportunities to prevent or mitigate adverse environmental impacts and enhance beneficial environmental impacts, particularly those with strategic and competitive implications. Top management can effectively address its risks and opportunities by integrating environmental management into the organization’s business processes, strategic direction and decision making, aligning them with other business priorities, and incorporating environmental governance into its overall management system. Demonstration of successful implementation of this International Standard can be used to assure interested parties that an effective environmental management system is in place. Adoption of this International Standard, however, will not in itself guarantee optimal environmental outcomes. Application of this International Standard can differ from one organization to another vi due to the context of the organization. Two organizations can carry out similar activities but can have different compliance obligations, commitments in their environmental policy, environmental technologies and environmental performance goals, yet both can conform to the requirements of this International Standard. The level of detail and complexity of the environmental management system will vary depending on the context of the organization, the scope of its environmental management system, its compliance obligations, and the nature of its activities, products and services, including its environmental aspects and associated environmental impacts.', '0.4': '0.4\\nPlan-Do-Check-Act model The basis for the approach underlying an environmental management system is founded on the concept of Plan-Do-Check-Act (PDCA). The PDCA model provides an iterative process used by organizations to achieve continual improvement. It can be applied to an environmental management system and to each of its individual elements. It can be briefly described as follows. — Plan: establish environmental objectives and processes necessary to deliver results in accordance with the organization’s environmental policy. — Do: implement the processes as planned. — Check: monitor and measure processes against the environmental policy, including its commitments, environmental objectives and operating criteria, and report the results. — Act: take actions to continually improve. Figure 1 shows how the framework introduced in this International Standard could be integrated into a PDCA model, which can help new and existing users to understand the importance of a systems approach. Figure 1 — Relationship between PDCA and the framework in this International Standard', '0.5': '0.5\\nContents of this International Standard This International Standard conforms to ISO’s requirements for management system standards. These requirements include a high level structure, identical core text, and common terms with core definitions, designed to benefit users implementing multiple ISO management system standards. This International Standard does not include requirements specific to other management systems, such as those for quality, occupational health and safety, energy or financial management. However, this International Standard enables an organization to use a common approach and risk-based thinking to integrate its environmental management system with the requirements of other management systems. This International Standard contains the requirements used to assess conformity. An organization that wishes to demonstrate conformity with this International Standard can do so by: — making a self-determination and self-declaration, or — seeking confirmation of its conformance by parties having an interest in the organization, such as customers, or — seeking confirmation of its self-declaration by a party external to the organization, or — seeking certification/registration of its environmental management system by an external organization. Annex A provides explanatory information to prevent misinterpretation of the requirements of this International Standard. Annex B shows broad technical correspondence between the previous edition of this International Standard and this edition. Implementation guidance on environmental management systems is included in ISO 14004. In this International Standard, the following verbal forms are used:— “shall” indicates a requirement; — “should” indicates a recommendation; — “may” indicates a permission; — “can” indicates a possibility or a capability. Information marked as “NOTE” is intended to assist the understanding or use of the document. “Notes to entry” used in Clause 3 provide additional information that supplements the terminological data and can contain provisions relating to the use of a term. The terms and definitions in Clause 3 are arranged in conceptual order, with an alphabetical index provided at the end of the document. viii with guidance for use', '1': '1 Scope\\nThis International Standard specifies the requirements for an environmental management system that an organization can use to enhance its environmental performance. This International Standard is intended for use by an organization seeking to manage its environmental responsibilities in a systematic manner that contributes to the environmental pillar of sustainability. This International Standard helps an organization achieve the intended outcomes of its environmental management system, which provide value for the environment, the organization itself and interested parties. Consistent with the organization’s environmental policy, the intended outcomes of an environmental management system include: — enhancement of environmental performance; — fulfilment of compliance obligations; — achievement of environmental objectives. This International Standard is applicable to any organization, regardless of size, type and nature, and applies to the environmental aspects of its activities, products and services that the organization determines it can either control or influence considering a life cycle perspective. This International Standard does not state specific environmental performance criteria. This International Standard can be used in whole or in part to systematically improve environmental management. Claims of conformity to this International Standard, however, are not acceptable unless all its requirements are incorporated into an organization’s environmental management system and fulfilled without exclusion.', '2': '2 Normative references\\nThere are no normative references.', '3': '3 Terms\\tand\\tdefinitions\\nFor the purposes of this document, the following terms and definitions apply.', '3.1': '3.1\\nTerms related to organization and leadership 3.1.1management systemset of interrelated or interacting elements of an organization (3.1.4 ) to establish policies and objectives (3.2.5 ) and processes (3.3.5 ) to achieve those objectives Note 1 to entry: A management system can address a single discipline or several disciplines (e.g. quality, environment, occupational health and safety, energy, financial management).

Annex A (informative) Guidance on the use of this International Standard', 'A.1': 'A.1 General\\nThe explanatory information given in this annex is intended to prevent misinterpretation of the requirements contained in this International Standard. While this information addresses and is consistent with these requirements, it is not intended to add to, subtract from, or in any way modify them. The requirements in this International Standard need to be viewed from a systems or holistic perspective. The user should not read a particular sentence or clause of this International Standard in isolation from other clauses. There is an interrelationship between the requirements in some clauses and the requirements in other clauses. For example, the organization needs to understand the relationship between the commitments in its environmental policy and the requirements that are specified in other clauses. Management of change is an important part of maintaining the environmental management system that ensures the organization can achieve the intended outcomes of its environmental management system on an ongoing basis. Management of change is addressed in various requirements of this International Standard, including — maintaining the environmental management system (see 4.4 ), — environmental aspects (see 6.1.2 ), — internal communication (see 7.4.2 ), — operational control (see 8.1 ), — internal audit programme (see 9.2.2 ), and — management review (see 9.3 ). As part of managing change, the organization should address planned and unplanned changes to ensure that the unintended consequences of these changes do not have a negative effect on the intended outcomes of the environmental management system. Examples of change include: — planned changes to products, processes, operations, equipment or facilities; — changes in staff or external providers, including contractors; — new information related to environmental aspects, environmental impacts and related technologies; — changes in compliance obligations.', 'A.2': 'A.2 Clarification\\tof\\tstructure\\tand\\tterminology\\nThe clause structure and some of the terminology of this International Standard have been changed to improve alignment with other management systems standards. There is, however, no requirement in this International Standard for its clause structure or terminology to be applied to an organization’s environmental management system documentation. There is no requirement to replace the terms used by an organization with the terms used in this International Standard. Organizations can choose to use terms that suit their business, e.g. “records”, “documentation”, or “protocols”, rather than “documented information”. 18 A.3 Clarification\\tof\\tconcepts In addition to the terms and definitions given in Clause 3, clarification of selected concepts is provided below to prevent misunderstanding. — In this International Standard, the use of the word “any” implies selection or choice. — The words “appropriate” and “applicable” are not interchangeable. “Appropriate” means suitable (for, to) and implies some degree of freedom, while “applicable” means relevant or possible to apply and implies that if it can be done, it needs to be done. — The word “consider” means it is necessary to think about the topic but it can be excluded; whereas “take into account” means it is necessary to think about the topic but it cannot be excluded. — “Continual” indicates duration that occurs over a period of time, but with intervals of interruption (unlike “continuous” which indicates duration without interruption). “Continual” is therefore the appropriate word to use when referring to improvement. — In this International Standard, the word “effect” is used to describe the result of a change to the organization. The phrase “environmental impact” refers specifically to the result of a change to the environment. — The word “ensure” means the responsibility can be delegated, but not the accountability. — This International Standard uses the term “interested party”; the term “stakeholder” is a synonym as it represents the same concept. This International Standard uses some new terminology. A brief explanation is given below to aid both new users and those who have used previous editions of this International Standard. — The phrase “compliance obligations” replaces the phrase “legal requirements and other requirements to which the organization subscribes” used in the previous edition of this International Standard. The intent of this new phrase does not differ from that of the previous edition. — “Documented information” replaces the nouns “documentation”, “documents” and “records” used in previous editions of this International Standard. To distinguish the intent of the generic term “documented information”, this International Standard now uses the phrase “retain documented information as evidence of....” to mean records, and “maintain documented information” to mean documentation other than records. The phrase “as evidence of….” is not a requirement to meet legal evidentiary requirements; its intent is only to indicate objective evidence needs to be retained. — The phrase “external provider” means an external supplier organization (including a contractor) that provides a product or a service. — The change from “identify” to “determine” is intended to harmonize with the standardized management system terminology. The word “determine” implies a discovery process that results in knowledge. The intent does not differ from that of previous editions. — The phrase “intended outcome” is what the organization intends to achieve by implementing its environmental management system. The minimal intended outcomes include enhancement of environmental performance, fulfilment of compliance obligations and achievement of environmental objectives. Organizations can set additional intended outcomes for their environmental management system. For example, consistent with their commitment to protection of the environment, an organization may establish an intended outcome to work towards sustainable development. — The phrase “person(s) doing work under its control” includes persons working for the organization and those working on its behalf for which the organization has responsibility (e.g. contractors). It replaces the phrase “persons working for it or on its behalf” and “persons working for or on behalf of the organization” used in the previous edition of this International Standard. The intent of this new phrase does not differ from that of the previous edition. — The concept of “target” used in previous editions of this International Standard is captured within the term “environmental objective”. A.', 'A.4.1': 'A.4.1\\nUnderstanding the organization and its context The intent of 4.1 is to provide a high-level, conceptual understanding of the important issues that can affect, either positively or negatively, the way the organization manages its environmental responsibilities. Issues are important topics for the organization, problems for debate and discussion or changing circumstances that affect the organization’s ability to achieve the intended outcomes it sets for its environmental management system. Examples of internal and external issues which can be relevant to the context of the organization include:a) environmental conditions related to climate, air quality, water quality, land use, existing contamination, natural resource availability and biodiversity, that can either affect the organization’s purpose, or be affected by its environmental aspects; b) the external cultural, social, political, legal, regulatory, financial, technological, economic, natural and competitive circumstances, whether international, national, regional or local; c) the internal characteristics or conditions of the organization, such as its activities, products and services, strategic direction, culture and capabilities (i.e. people, knowledge, processes, systems). An understanding of the context of an organization is used to establish, implement, maintain and continually improve its environmental management system (see 4.4). The internal and external issues that are determined in 4.1 can result in risks and opportunities to the organization or to the environmental management system (see 6.1.1 to 6.1.3 ). The organization determines those that need to be addressed and managed (see 6.1.4 , 6.2 , Clause 7, Clause 8 and 9.1 ).', 'A.4.2': 'A.4.2\\nUnderstanding the needs and expectations of interested parties An organization is expected to gain a general (i.e. high-level, not detailed) understanding of the expressed needs and expectations of those internal and external interested parties that have been determined by the organization to be relevant. The organization considers the knowledge gained when determining which of these needs and expectations it has to or it chooses to comply with, i.e. its compliance obligations (see 6.1.1 ). In the case of an interested party perceiving itself to be affected by the organization’s decisions or activities related to environmental performance, the organization considers the relevant needs and expectations that are made known or have been disclosed by the interested party to the organization. Interested party requirements are not necessarily requirements of the organization. Some interested party requirements reflect needs and expectations that are mandatory because they have been incorporated into laws, regulations, permits and licences by governmental or even court decision. The organization may decide to voluntarily agree to or adopt other requirements of interested parties (e.g. entering into a contractual relationship, subscribing to a voluntary initiative). Once the organization adopts them, they become organizational requirements (i.e. compliance obligations) and are taken into account when planning the environmental management system (see 4.4). A more detailed-level analysis of its compliance obligations is performed in 6.1.3 .', 'A.4.3': 'A.4.3\\nDetermining the scope of the environmental management system The scope of the environmental management system is intended to clarify the physical and organizational boundaries to which the environmental management system applies, especially if the organization is a part of a larger organization. An organization has the freedom and flexibility to define its boundaries. It may choose to implement this International Standard throughout the entire 20 organization, or only in (a) specific part(s) of the organization, as long as the top management for that (those) part(s) has authority to establish an environmental management system. In setting the scope, the credibility of the environmental management system depends upon the choice of organizational boundaries. The organization considers the extent of control or influence that it can exert over activities, products and services considering a life cycle perspective. Scoping should not be used to exclude activities, products, services, or facilities that have or can have significant environmental aspects, or to evade its compliance obligations. The scope is a factual and representative statement of the organization’s operations included within its environmental management system boundaries that should not mislead interested parties. Once the organization asserts it conforms to this International Standard, the requirement to make the scope statement available to interested parties applies.', 'A.4.4': 'A.4.4\\nEnvironmental management system The organization retains authority and accountability to decide how it fulfils the requirements of this International Standard, including the level of detail and extent to which it: a) establishes one or more processes to have confidence that it (they) is (are) controlled, carried out as planned and achieve the desired results; b) integrates environmental management system requirements into its various business processes, such as design and development, procurement, human resources, sales and marketing; c) incorporates issues associated with the context of the organization (see 4.1 ) and interested party requirements (see 4.2 ) within its environmental management system. If this International Standard is implemented for (a) specific part(s) of an organization, policies, processes and documented information developed by other parts of the organization can be used to meet the requirements of this International Standard, provided they are applicable to that (those) specific part(s). For information on maintaining the environmental management system as part of management of change, see Clause A.1 .', 'A.5': 'A.5 Leadership', 'A.5.1': 'A.5.1\\nLeadership and commitment To demonstrate leadership and commitment, there are specific responsibilities related to the environmental management system in which top management should be personally involved or which top management should direct. Top management may delegate responsibility for these actions to others, but it retains accountability for ensuring the actions are performed.', 'A.5.2': 'A.5.2\\nEnvironmental policy An environmental policy is a set of principles stated as commitments in which top management outlines the intentions of the organization to support and enhance its environmental performance. The environmental policy enables the organization to set its environmental objectives (see 6.2), take actions to achieve the intended outcomes of the environmental management system, and achieve continual improvement (see Clause 10). Three basic commitments for the environmental policy are specified in this International Standard to: a) protect the environment; b) fulfil the organization’s compliance obligations; c) continually improve the environmental management system to enhance environmental performance. These commitments are then reflected in the processes an organization establishes to address specific requirements in this International Standard, to ensure a robust, credible and reliable environmental management system. The commitment to protect the environment is intended to not only prevent adverse environmental impacts through prevention of pollution, but to protect the natural environment from harm and degradation arising from the organization’s activities, products and services. The specific commitment(s) an organization pursues should be relevant to the context of the organization, including the local or regional environmental conditions. These commitments can address, for example, water quality, recycling, or air quality, and can also include commitments related to climate change mitigation and adaptation, protection of biodiversity and ecosystems, and restoration. While all the commitments are important, some interested parties are especially concerned with the organization’s commitment to fulfil its compliance obligations, particularly applicable legal requirements. This International Standard specifies a number of interconnected requirements related to this commitment. These include the need to: — determine compliance obligations; — ensure operations are carried out in accordance with these compliance obligations; — evaluate fulfilment of the compliance obligations; — correct nonconformities.', 'A.5.3': 'A.5.3\\nOrganizational roles, responsibilities and authorities Those involved in the organization’s environmental management system should have a clear understanding of their role, responsibility(ies) and authority(ies) for conforming to the requirements of this International Standard and achieving the intended outcomes. The specific roles and responsibilities identified in 5.3 may be assigned to an individual, sometimes referred to as the “management representative”, shared by several individuals, or assigned to a member of top management.', 'A.6': 'A.6 Planning', 'A.6.1': 'A.6.1\\nActions to address risks and opportunities', 'A.6.1.1': 'A.6.1.1\\nGeneral The overall intent of the process(es) established in 6.1.1 is to ensure that the organization is able to achieve the intended outcomes of its environmental management system, to prevent or reduce undesired effects, and to achieve continual improvement. The organization can ensure this by determining its risks and opportunities that need to be addressed and planning action to address them. These risks and opportunities can be related to environmental aspects, compliance obligations, other issues or other needs and expectations of interested parties. Environmental aspects (see 6.1.2 ) can create risks and opportunities associated with adverse environmental impacts, beneficial environmental impacts, and other effects on the organization. The risks and opportunities related to environmental aspects can be determined as part of the significance evaluation or determined separately. Compliance obligations (see 6.1.3 ) can create risks and opportunities, such as failing to comply (which can damage the organization’s reputation or result in legal action) or performing beyond its compliance obligations (which can enhance the organization’s reputation). 22 The organization can also have risks and opportunities related to other issues, including environmental conditions or needs and expectations of interested parties, which can affect the organization’s ability to achieve the intended outcomes of its environmental management system, e.g. a) environmental spillage due to literacy or language barriers among workers who cannot understand local work procedures; b) increased flooding due to climate change that could affect the organizations premises; c) lack of available resources to maintain an effective environmental management system due to economic constraints; d) introducing new technology financed by governmental grants, which could improve air quality; e) water scarcity during periods of drought that could affect the organization’s ability to operate its emission control equipment. Emergency situations are unplanned or unexpected events that need the urgent application of specific competencies, resources or processes to prevent or mitigate their actual or potential consequences. Emergency situations can result in adverse environmental impacts or other effects on the organization. When determining potential emergency situations (e.g. fire, chemical spill, severe weather), the organization should consider: — the nature of onsite hazards (e.g. flammable liquids, storage tanks, compressed gasses); — the most likely type and scale of an emergency situation; — the potential for emergency situations at a nearby facility (e.g. plant, road, railway line). Although risks and opportunities need to be determined and addressed, there is no requirement for formal risk management or a documented risk management process. It is up to the organization to select the method it will use to determine its risks and opportunities. The method may involve a simple qualitative process or a full quantitative assessment depending on the context in which the organization operates. The risks and opportunities identified (see 6.1.1 to 6.1.3 ) are inputs for planning actions (see 6.1.4 ) and for establishing the environmental objectives (see 6.2 ).', 'A.6.1.2': 'A.6.1.2\\nEnvironmental aspects An organization determines its environmental aspects and associated environmental impacts, and determines those that are significant and, therefore, need to be addressed by its environmental management system. Changes to the environment, either adverse or beneficial, that result wholly or partially from environmental aspects are called environmental impacts. The environmental impact can occur at local, regional and global scales, and also can be direct, indirect or cumulative by nature. The relationship between environmental aspects and environmental impacts is one of cause and effect. When determining environmental aspects, the organization considers a life cycle perspective. This does not require a detailed life cycle assessment; thinking carefully about the life cycle stages that can be controlled or influenced by the organization is sufficient. Typical stages of a product (or service) life cycle include raw material acquisition, design, production, transportation/delivery, use, end-of-life treatment and final disposal. The life cycle stages that are applicable will vary depending on the activity, product or service. An organization needs to determine the environmental aspects within the scope of its environmental management system. It takes into account the inputs and outputs (both intended and unintended) that are associated with its current and relevant past activities, products and services; planned or new developments; and new or modified activities, products and services. The method used should consider normal and abnormal operating conditions, shut-down and start-up conditions, as well as the reasonably foreseeable emergency situations identified in 6.1.1 . Attention should be paid to prior occurrences of emergency situations. For information on environmental aspects as part of managing change, see Clause A.1 . An organization does not have to consider each product, component or raw material individually to determine and evaluate their environmental aspects; it may group or categorize activities, products and services when they have common characteristics. When determining its environmental aspects, the organization can consider:a) emissions to air; b) releases to water; c) releases to land; d) use of raw materials and natural resources; e) use of energy; f) energy emitted (e.g. heat, radiation, vibration (noise), light); g) generation of waste and/or by-products; h) use of space. In addition to the environmental aspects that it can control directly, an organization determines whether there are environmental aspects that it can influence. These can be related to products and services used by the organization which are provided by others, as well as products and services that it provides to others, including those associated with (an) outsourced process(es). With respect to those an organization provides to others, it can have limited influence on the use and end-of-life treatment of the products and services. In all circumstances, however, it is the organization that determines the extent of control it is able to exercise, the environmental aspects it can influence, and the extent to which it chooses to exercise such influence. Consideration should be given to environmental aspects related to the organization’s activities, products and services, such as: — design and development of its facilities, processes, products and services; — acquisition of raw materials, including extraction; — operational or manufacturing processes, including warehousing; — operation and maintenance of facilities, organizational assets and infrastructure; — environmental performance and practices of external providers; — product transportation and service delivery, including packaging; — storage, use and end-of-life treatment of products; — waste management, including reuse, refurbishing, recycling and disposal. There is no single method for determining significant environmental aspects, however, the method and criteria used should provide consistent results. The organization sets the criteria for determining its significant environmental aspects. Environmental criteria are the primary and minimum criteria for assessing environmental aspects. Criteria can relate to the environmental aspect (e.g. type, size, frequency) or the environmental impact (e.g. scale, severity, duration, exposure). Other criteria may also be used. An environmental aspect might not be significant when only considering environmental criteria. It can, however, reach or exceed the threshold for determining significance when other criteria are considered. These other criteria can include organizational issues, such as legal requirements or interested party concerns. These other criteria are not intended to be used to downgrade an aspect that is significant based on its environmental impact. 24 A significant environmental aspect can result in one or more significant environmental impacts, and can therefore result in risks and opportunities that need to be addressed to ensure the organization can achieve the intended outcomes of its environmental management system.', 'A.6.1.3': 'A.6.1.3\\nCompliance obligations The organization determines, at a sufficiently detailed level, the compliance obligations it identified in 4.2 that are applicable to its environmental aspects, and how they apply to the organization. Compliance obligations include legal requirements that an organization has to comply with and other requirements that the organization has to or chooses to comply with. Mandatory legal requirements related to an organization’s environmental aspects can include, if applicable: a) requirements from governmental entities or other relevant authorities; b) international, national and local laws and regulations; c) requirements specified in permits, licenses or other forms of authorization; d) orders, rules or guidance from regulatory agencies; e) judgements of courts or administrative tribunals. Compliance obligations also include other interested party requirements related to its environmental management system which the organization has to or chooses to adopt. These can include, if applicable: — agreements with community groups or non-governmental organizations; — agreements with public authorities or customers; — organizational requirements; — voluntary principles or codes of practice; — voluntary labelling or environmental commitments; — obligations arising under contractual arrangements with the organization; — relevant organizational or industry standards.', 'A.6.1.4': 'A.6.1.4\\nPlanning action The organization plans, at a high level, the actions that have to be taken within the environmental management system to address its significant environmental aspects, its compliance obligations, and the risks and opportunities identified in 6.1.1 that are a priority for the organization to achieve the intended outcomes of its environmental management system. The actions planned may include establishing environmental objectives (see 6.2) or may be incorporated into other environmental management system processes, either individually or in combination. Some actions may be addressed through other management systems, such as those related to occupational health and safety or business continuity, or through other business processes related to risk, financial or human resource management. When considering its technological options, an organization should consider the use of best-available techniques, where economically viable, cost-effective and judged appropriate. This is not intended to imply that organizations are obliged to use environmental cost-accounting methodologies.', 'A.6.2': 'A.6.2\\nEnvironmental objectives and planning to achieve them Top management may establish environmental objectives at the strategic level, the tactical level or the operational level. The strategic level includes the highest levels of the organization and the environmental objectives can be applicable to the whole organization. The tactical and operational levels can include environmental objectives for specific units or functions within the organization and should be compatible with its strategic direction. Environmental objectives should be communicated to persons working under the organization’s control who have the ability to influence the achievement of environmental objectives. The requirement to “take into account significant environmental aspects” does not mean that an environmental objective has to be established for each significant environmental aspect, however, these have a high priority when establishing environmental objectives. “Consistent with the environmental policy” means that the environmental objectives are broadly aligned and harmonized with the commitments made by top management in the environmental policy, including the commitment to continual improvement. Indicators are selected to evaluate the achievement of measurable environmental objectives. “Measurable” means it is possible to use either quantitative or qualitative methods in relation to a specified scale to determine if the environmental objective has been achieved. By specifying “if practicable”, it is acknowledged that there can be situations when it is not feasible to measure an environmental objective, however, it is important that the organization is able to determine whether or not an environmental objective has been achieved. For additional information on environmental indicators, see ISO 14031.', 'A.7': 'A.7 Support', 'A.7.1': 'A.7.1\\nResources Resources are needed for the effective functioning and improvement of the environmental management system and to enhance environmental performance. Top management should ensure that those with environmental management system responsibilities are supported with the necessary resources. Internal resources may be supplemented by (an) external provider(s). Resources can include human resources, natural resources, infrastructure, technology and financial resources. Examples of human resources include specialized skills and knowledge. Examples of infrastructure resources include the organization’s buildings, equipment, underground tanks and drainage system.', 'A.7.2': 'A.7.2\\nCompetence The competency requirements of this International Standard apply to persons working under the organization’s control who affect its environmental performance, including persons: a) whose work has the potential to cause a significant environmental impact; b) who are assigned responsibilities for the environmental management system, including those who: 1) determine and evaluate environmental impacts or compliance obligations; 2) contribute to the achievement of an environmental objective; 3) respond to emergency situations; 4) perform internal audits; 5) perform evaluations of compliance.', 'A.7.3': 'A.7.3\\nAwareness Awareness of the environmental policy should not be taken to mean that the commitments need to be memorized or that persons doing work under the organization’s control have a copy of the documented 26 environmental policy. Rather, these persons should be aware of its existence, its purpose and their role in achieving the commitments, including how their work can affect the organization’s ability to fulfil its compliance obligations.', 'A.7.4': 'A.7.4\\nCommunication Communication allows the organization to provide and obtain information relevant to its environmental management system, including information related to its significant environmental aspects, environmental performance, compliance obligations and recommendations for continual improvement. Communication is a two-way process, in and out of the organization. When establishing its communication process(es), the internal organizational structure should be considered to ensure communication with the most appropriate levels and functions. A single approach can be adequate to meet the needs of many different interested parties, or multiple approaches might be necessary to address specific needs of individual interested parties. The information received by the organization can contain requests from interested parties for specific information related to the management of its environmental aspects, or can contain general impressions or views on the way the organization carries out that management. These impressions or views can be positive or negative. In the latter case (e.g. complaints), it is important that a prompt and clear answer is provided by the organization. A subsequent analysis of these complaints can provide valuable information for detecting improvement opportunities for the environmental management system. Communication should:a) be transparent, i.e. the organization is open in the way it derives what it has reported on; b) be appropriate, so that information meets the needs of relevant interested parties, enabling them to participate; c) be truthful and not misleading to those who rely on the information reported; d) be factual, accurate and able to be trusted; e) not exclude relevant information; f) be understandable to interested parties. For information on communication as part of managing change, see Clause A.1 . For additional information on communication, see ISO 14063.', 'A.7.5': 'A.7.5\\nDocumented information An organization should create and maintain documented information in a manner sufficient to ensure a suitable, adequate and effective environmental management system. The primary focus should be on the implementation of the environmental management system and on environmental performance, not on a complex documented information control system. In addition to the documented information required in specific clauses of this International Standard, an organization may choose to create additional documented information for purposes of transparency, accountability, continuity, consistency, training, or ease in auditing. Documented information originally created for purposes other than the environmental management system may be used. The documented information associated with the environmental management system may be integrated with other information management systems implemented by the organization. It does not have to be in the form of a manual. A.8 Operation', 'A.8.1': 'A.8.1\\nOperational planning and control The type and extent of operational control(s) depend on the nature of the operations, the risks and opportunities, significant environmental aspects and compliance obligations. An organization has the flexibility to select the type of operational control methods, individually or in combination, that are necessary to make sure the process(es) is (are) effective and achieve(s) the desired results. Such methods can include: a) designing (a) process(es) in such a way as to prevent error and ensure consistent results; b) using technology to control (a) process(es) and prevent adverse results (i.e. engineering controls); c) using competent personnel to ensure the desired results; d) performing (a) process(es) in a specified way; e) monitoring or measuring (a) process(es) to check the results; f) determining the use and amount of documented information necessary. The organization decides the extent of control needed within its own business processes (e.g. procurement process) to control or influence (an) outsourced process(es) or (a) provider(s) of products and services. Its decision should be based upon factors such as: — knowledge, competence and resources, including: — the competence of the external provider to meet the organization’s environmental management system requirements; — the technical competence of the organization to define appropriate controls or assess the adequacy of controls; — the importance and potential effect the product and service will have on the organization’s ability to achieve the intended outcome of its environmental management system; — the extent to which control of the process is shared; — the capability of achieving the necessary control through the application of its general procurement process; — improvement opportunities available. When a process is outsourced, or when products and services are supplied by (an) external provider(s), the organization’s ability to exert control or influence can vary from direct control to limited or no influence. In some cases, an outsourced process performed onsite might be under the direct control of an organization; in other cases, an organization’s ability to influence an outsourced process or external supplier might be limited. When determining the type and extent of operational controls related to external providers, including contractors, the organization may consider one or more factors such as: — environmental aspects and associated environmental impacts; — risks and opportunities associated with the manufacturing of its products or the provision of its services; — the organization’s compliance obligations. For information on operational control as part of managing change, see Clause A.1 . For information on life cycle perspective, see A.6.1.2 . 28 An outsourced process is one that fulfils all of the following: — it is within the scope of the environmental management system; — it is integral to the organization’s functioning; — it is needed for the environmental management system to achieve its intended outcome; — liability for conforming to requirements is retained by the organization; — the organization and the external provider have a relationship where the process is perceived by interested parties as being carried out by the organization. Environmental requirements are the organization’s environmentally-related needs and expectations that it establishes for, and communicates to, its interested parties (e.g. an internal function, such as procurement; a customer; an external provider). Some of the organization’s significant environmental impacts can occur during the transportation, delivery, use, end-of-life treatment or final disposal of its product or service. By providing information, an organization can potentially prevent or mitigate adverse environmental impacts during these life cycle stages.', 'A.8.2': 'A.8.2\\nEmergency preparedness and response It is the responsibility of each organization to be prepared and to respond to emergency situations in a manner appropriate to its particular needs. For information on determining emergency situations, see A.6.1.1 .

The environmental performance analysis and evaluation results should be reported to those with responsibility and authority to initiate appropriate action. For additional information on environmental performance evaluation, see ISO 14031.', 'A.9.1.2': 'A.9.1.2\\nEvaluation of compliance The frequency and timing of compliance evaluations can vary depending on the importance of the requirement, variations in operating conditions, changes in compliance obligations and the organization’s past performance. An organization can use a variety of methods to maintain its knowledge and understanding of its compliance status, however, all compliance obligations need to be evaluated periodically. If compliance evaluation results indicate a failure to fulfil a legal requirement, the organization needs to determine and implement the actions necessary to achieve compliance. This might require communication with a regulatory agency and agreement on a course of action to fulfil its legal requirements. Where such an agreement is in place, it becomes a compliance obligation.', 'A.9.2': 'A.9.2\\nInternal audit Auditors should be independent of the activity being audited, wherever practicable, and should in all cases act in a manner that is free from bias and conflict of interest.

This document specifies the energy management system (EnMS) requirements for an organization. Successful implementation of an EnMS supports a culture of energy performance improvement that depends upon commitment from all levels of the organization, especially top management. In many instances, this involves cultural changes within an organization. This document applies to the activities under the control of the organization. Its application can be tailored to fit the specific requirements of the organization, including the complexity of its systems, degree of documented information and available resources. This document does not apply to product use by end-users outside of the scope and boundaries of the EnMS, nor does it apply to product design outside of facilities, equipment, systems or energy-using processes. This document does apply to the design and procurement of facilities, equipment, systems or energy-using processes within the scope and boundaries of the EnMS. Development and implementation of an EnMS includes an energy policy, objectives, energy targets and action plans related to its energy efficiency, energy use, and energy consumption while meeting applicable legal requirements and other requirements. An EnMS enables an organization to set and achieve objectives and energy targets, to take actions as needed to improve its energy performance, and to demonstrate the conformity of its system to the requirements of this document.', '0.2': '0.2\\nEnergy performance approach This document provides requirements for a systematic, data-driven and facts-based process, focused on continually improving energy performance. Energy performance is a key element integrated within the concepts introduced in this document in order to ensure effective and measurable results over time. Energy performance is a concept which is related to energy efficiency, energy use and energy consumption. Energy performance indicators (EnPIs) and energy baselines (EnBs) are two interrelated elements addressed in this document to enable organizations to demonstrate energy performance improvement.', '0.3': \"0.3\\nPlan-Do-Check-Act (PDCA) cycle The EnMS described in this document is based on the Plan-Do-Check-Act (PDCA) continual improvement framework and incorporates energy management into existing organizational practices, as illustrated in Figure 1 . In the context of energy management, the PDCA approach can be outlined as follows. — Plan : understand the context of the organization, establish an energy policy and an energy management team, consider actions to address risks and opportunities, conduct an energy review, identify significant energy uses (SEUs) and establish energy performance indicators (EnPIs), energy baseline(s) (EnBs), objectives and energy targets, and action plans necessary to deliver results that will improve energy performance in accordance with the organization's energy policy. — Do: implement the action plans, operational and maintenance controls, and communication, ensure competence and consider energy performance in design and procurement. — Check : monitor, measure, analyse, evaluate, audit and conduct management review(s) of energy performance and the EnMS. — Act: take actions to address nonconformities and continually improve energy performance and the EnMS.

This document can be used independently; however, an organization can choose to combine its EnMS with other management systems, or integrate its EnMS in the achievement of other business, environmental or social objectives. Two organizations carrying out similar operations, but having different energy performance, can both conform to the requirements of ISO 50001. This document contains the requirements used to assess conformity. An organization that wishes to demonstrate conformity with this document can do so by: — making an evaluation and self-declaration, or — seeking confirmation of its conformance or self-declaration by interested parties, such as customers, or — seeking certification/registration of its EnMS by an external organization.

While this information addresses and is consistent with the requirements, it is not intended to add to, subtract from, or in any way modify these requirements.', 'A.2': 'A.2 Relationship between energy performance and the EnMS\\nThis document addresses both energy performance improvement and a management system approach to managing energy. The EnMS utilizes interrelated elements such as energy performance indicators (EnPIs) and energy baselines (EnBs) as a means to demonstrate measurable improvements in energy efficiency or energy consumption, related to energy use (see Figure A.1). Figure A.1 — Relationship between energy performance and EnMS While this document requires demonstration of energy performance improvement, it is the organization that defines its energy performance and energy targets as well as how energy performance improvement will be demonstrated. A.3 Clarification\\tof\\tterminology The clause structure and some of the terminology of this document have been changed from the previous edition to improve alignment with other management system standards. There is, however, no requirement in this document for its clause structure or terminology to be applied to an organization’s EnMS documentation. There is no requirement to replace the terms used by an organization with the terms used in this document. Organizations can choose to use terms that suit their business and needs, or to use those found in this document. — In this document, the use of the word “any” implies selection or choice. — The words “appropriate” and “applicable” are not interchangeable. “Appropriate” means suitable (for, to) and implies some degree of freedom, while “applicable” means relevant or possible to apply and implies that if it can be done, it needs to be done. — The word “consider” means it is necessary to think about the topic but it can be excluded, whereas “take into account” means it is necessary to think about the topic but it cannot be excluded. — The word “ensure” means the responsibility can be delegated, but not the accountability. — This document uses the term “interested party”; the term “stakeholder” is a synonym as it represents the same concept. This edition uses some new terminology. A brief explanation is given below. As part of the alignment with other management system standards, a common clause on documented information has been adopted without significant change or addition (see 7.5). Consequently, the terms “documented procedure” and “record” have both been replaced throughout the text by “documented information”. — “Documented information” replaces the nouns “documentation”, “documents” and “records” used in previous editions of this document. To distinguish the intent of the generic term “documented information”, this document now uses the phrase “retain documented information...” to mean records, and “maintain documented information” to mean documentation other than records that is kept up to date. — The phrase “intended outcome” is what the organization intends to achieve by implementing its EnMS and working toward improved energy performance. — The phrase “person(s) doing work under its control” includes persons working for the organization and those working on its behalf for which the organization has responsibility (e.g. contractors, service providers). It replaces the phrase “persons working for it or on its behalf” and “persons working for or on behalf of the organization” used in the previous edition of this document. The intent of this new phrase does not differ from that of the previous edition.

Even if it delegates some responsibilities, the overall accountability still stays with top management.

By identifying risks and opportunities when planning the EnMS, an organization can anticipate potential scenarios and consequences so that undesired effects can be addressed before they occur. Similarly, favourable considerations or circumstances that can offer potential advantages or beneficial outcomes can be identified and pursued. Figure A.2 provides a conceptual diagram to improve understanding of the energy planning process. Figure A.2 does not represent the details of a specific organization. The information in Figure A.2 is illustrative but is not meant to be exhaustive, and there can be other details specific to the organization or to particular circumstances. Figure A.2 — Energy planning process', 'A.6.2': 'A.6.2\\nObjectives, energy targets and planning to achieve them Objectives can include both overall improvements to an EnMS and specific, measurable energy performance improvement targets. While some objectives will be quantifiable and have targets for energy performance improvement (e.g. reduce electricity consumption by 3 % by the end of the year, 2 % plant efficiency improvement by fourth quarter), other objectives can be qualitative (e.g. relating to energy behaviour, cultural change). It is often possible to provide some quantitative values for qualitative objectives, through surveys or other similar mechanisms.', 'A.6.3': 'A.6.3\\nEnergy review The process of identification of energy types and evaluation of energy use and energy consumption leads the organization to determine areas of significant energy use and identify opportunities for improving energy performance. In determining its SEUs, the organization determines the criteria for what is substantial energy consumption and/or what is a considerable potential for energy performance improvement. SEUs can be defined depending on the needs of the organization, such as by facility (e.g. warehouse, factory, office), by process or system (e.g. lighting, steam, transport, electrolysis, motor- driven) or equipment (e.g. motor, boiler). Once identified, the management and control of SEUs are an integral part of the EnMS. Person(s) working under the control of the organization can include service contractors, part-time personnel and temporary staff. 22 Updating the energy review includes updating the data and information related to the analysis of energy use and energy consumption, determination of SEUs and identification of opportunities for improving energy performance. Not all parts of the energy review need to be updated at the same time. A formal energy audit can be used to assist in identifying opportunities for energy performance improvement in detail. An energy audit can provide information on one or more parts of the energy review. The scope of an energy audit can comprise a detailed review of the energy performance of an organization, SEU(s), systems, energy-using processes and/or equipment. It is typically based on appropriate measurement and observation of actual energy performance for the defined energy audit scope. Energy audit outputs typically include information on current energy consumption and energy performance, and they can be accompanied by a series of specific recommendations ranked by energy performance improvement or financial return on investment, based on analysis of specific site data and operating conditions. When looking for energy performance improvement opportunities, organizations should consider the extent to which energy is required for a particular process, or is recoverable. Even where a process such as a chemical reaction has limited improvement opportunities due to the energy requirements based on scientific laws, the auxiliary equipment can offer significant energy performance improvement potential, as can improved process control or equipment scheduling. Opportunities can also emerge over time due to changes in operating loads and parameters, equipment degradation and improvements in available technologies and techniques. Opportunities can also be identified in how equipment and systems are operated and maintained. The installation of a renewable energy type within the scope and boundaries of the EnMS, as defined by the organization, does not represent an energy performance improvement. Energy consumption across the boundary can decrease, however, there will be no measurable improvement in energy efficiency or energy consumption related to energy use as a result of the change. The consumption of renewable energy can have a positive environmental effect and other benefits and an organization can have an objective to increase its installation of renewable energy. In such cases, an organization needs to assess the renewable energy production separately. Where appropriate, an energy review can also consider security and availability of energy supply.', 'A.6.4': 'A.6.4\\nEnergy performance indicators An EnPI is a “ruler” that is used to compare energy performance before (reference EnPI value) and after (resultant or current EnPI value) the implementation of action plans and other actions (see Figure A.3 ).

Effectiveness of the EnMS can be demonstrated by improvement in energy performance and other intended outcomes. Energy performance improvement can be demonstrated by improvements in EnPI values over time, relative to the corresponding EnB. There can be situations where energy performance improvement is achieved from an activity that is not related to an SEU or key characteristic. In those instances, an EnPI and EnB can be established to demonstrate energy performance improvement. When conducting analysis, the limitations of the data (accuracy, precision, measurement uncertainty) and consistency of energy accounting should be taken into account before reaching final conclusions.', 'A.9.2': 'A.9.2\\nInternal audit Internal audits of an EnMS can be performed by employees of the organization, or by external persons selected by the organization and working on its behalf. Auditor independence can be demonstrated by an auditor being free from responsibility for the activity being audited. An energy audit or energy assessment is not the same concept as an internal audit of an EnMS. A.9.3 Management review The management review covers the entire scope of the EnMS, although not all elements of the EnMS need to be reviewed at once. The review process can take place over a period of time.', 'A.10': 'A.10 Improvement\\n“Continual” implies occurrence over a period of time, but can include intervals of interruption (unlike “continuous” which indicates occurrence without interruption). In the context of continual improvement, the expectation is that improvements occur periodically, over time. The rate, extent and timescale of actions that support continual improvement are determined by the organization, in light of its context, economic factors and other circumstances. Energy performance improvement can be demonstrated in several ways, such as: a) reduction in normalized energy consumption for the scope and boundaries of the EnMS; b) progress toward the energy target(s) and management of the SEUs. It is recognized that improvements are achieved based on the priorities of the organization. Examples of continual energy performance improvement include, but are not limited to, the following. — Total energy consumption decreases over time under similar conditions, e.g. a commercial building in a region where the temperature does not vary significantly. — Total energy consumption increases, but the measure of energy performance as defined by the organization improves. In this case, a simple ratio where there is one relevant variable and no baseload. — Equipment has a predicted reduction in energy performance as it ages. A delay or reduction in the performance reduction curve due to proper operational and maintenance controls can demonstrate improved energy performance as defined by the organizational EnPIs. — In resource extraction industries where energy performance tends to decline as resources are depleted, e.g. in a mining facility where the depth and production both vary, reducing the rate of decline relative to the EnB can be considered a performance improvement. — In most situations and organizations, there are multiple relevant variables requiring normalization, e.g. a dairy producing three different products (milk, cheese, yogurt) and affected by weather. 26 © ISO 2018 – All rights reserved'}, 'ISO standards\\\\ISO_IEC_30134-1_2016(en).pdf': {'2': '2 Normative references\\nThere are no normative references cited in this document.', '1': '1 Scope\\nThis part of ISO/IEC 30134 specifies the following for the other parts of ISO/IEC 30134: a) a common structure; b) definitions, terminology and boundary conditions for KPIs of data centre resource usage effectiveness and efficiency; c) common requirements for KPIs of data centre resource usage effectiveness and efficiency; d) common objectives for KPIs of the data centre resource effectiveness and efficiency; e) general information regarding the use of KPIs of data centre resource usage effectiveness and efficiency.', '3': '3 Terms,\\tdefinitions and\\tabbreviations', '3.1': '3.1\\nTerms\\tand\\tdefinitions For the purposes of this document, the following terms and definitions apply.', '3.1.1': '3.1.1\\nbuilding\\tentrance\\tfacilityfacility that provides all necessary mechanical and electrical services for the entry of telecommunications cables into a building and which may allow for transition from external to internal cable', '3.1.2': '3.1.2\\ncomputer room spacearea within the data centre that accommodates the data processing, data storage and telecommunication equipment that provides the primary function of the data centre', '3.1.3': '3.1.3\\ncontrol room space area within the data centre used to control the operation of the data centre and to act as a central point for all control and monitoring functionsINTERNATIONAL ST ANDARD ISO/IEC 30134-1:2016(E)', '3.1.4': '3.1.4\\ndata centrestructure, or group of structures, dedicated to the centralized accommodation, interconnection and operation of information technology and network telecommunications equipment providing data storage, processing and transport services together with all the facilities and infrastructures for power distribution and environmental control together with the necessary levels of resilience and security required to provide the desired service availability Note 1 to entry: A structure can consist of multiple buildings and/or spaces with specific functions to support the primary function.

However, availability objectives and location can constrain the achievable improvements. There should be no “judgement” of an actual KPI without attaching to the data point a description of availability objectives and the location/climate of the data centre under consideration. KPIs should be used to help data centre managers to improve the data centre’s resource usage effectiveness or efficiency by comparing and assessing improvement options.', 'A.2': 'A.2 Data\\tcentre\\tavailability\\tobjectives\\nThe availability objectives of a data centre can restrict such improvements due to the use of redundant infrastructure components and infrastructures necessary to respond the following circumstances: a) the user of the data centre will either set or demand a series of service level agreements (SLAs) based upon the criticality of their business case covering continuity and quality of power and environmental control provision, connectivity and security; b) the SLAs will reflect directly the appetite for risk that the user has and their ability or willingness to accept shutdowns for maintenance and repairs in the critical systems; c) data centres whose users can accept high levels of risk, scheduled shutdowns for maintenance and shutdowns for fault repair can reach very low design KPIs; d) data centres whose users cannot accept risk of failure and demand concurrent maintenance and inherent fault tolerance are limited by those SLAs to a higher design (and actual) KPI than those facilities described above. Infrastructure design solutions to provide increasing availability are described in a number of International Standards including the EN 50600 series. These solutions generally range from “single- path (no redundancy of components)” to “multi-path (fault tolerant even during maintenance)”. The power supply and distribution system provides an example of the relationship between absolute energy consumption (contribution to KPIs) and availability of service (level of SLA). Typically, IT equipment will be impacted by disruption of supply lasting longer than 10 ms and as a result, uninterruptible power supply (UPS) systems are generally used to support utility power grid systems unable to meet the IT equipment needs. IEC 62040-3 describes the topologies of UPS systems and, in general, the maximum efficiency for each technology reduces as the degree of protection increases. As a result, the availability architecture and the level of protection will dictate the contribution to KPIs which address energy consumption of the power supply and distribution system. Tolerance to faults and ensuring availability to meet SLAs are important factors in the energy consumption of data centre equipment and infrastructures including environmental control. The criticality level and redundancy employed to the power delivery, cooling, IT and IT support systems are key factors in the resource consumption, effectiveness or efficiency levels of the data centre. A.3 Data centre location Resource availability and consumption can be impacted by physical location. For example, free-cooling (compressor-less mechanical thermal management) is less effective for higher external temperatures. 10 Bibliography [1] IEC 62040-3, Uninterruptible power systems (UPS) — Part 3: Method of specifying the performance and test requirements [2] EN 50600 series, Information technology — Data centre facilities and infrastructures Price based on 11 pages'}}\n"

Sustainable development as a goal is achieved by balancing the three pillars of sustainability. Societal expectations for sustainable development, transparency and accountability have evolved with increasingly stringent legislation, growing pressures on the environment from pollution, inefficient use of resources, improper waste management, climate change, degradation of ecosystems and loss of biodiversity. This has led organizations to adopt a systematic approach to environmental management by implementing environmental management systems with the aim of contributing to the environmental pillar of sustainability.'),\n",

Organizations can leverage opportunities to prevent or mitigate adverse environmental impacts and enhance beneficial environmental impacts, particularly those with strategic and competitive implications. Top management can effectively address its risks and opportunities by integrating environmental management into the organization’s business processes, strategic direction and decision making, aligning them with other business priorities, and incorporating environmental governance into its overall management system. Demonstration of successful implementation of this International Standard can be used to assure interested parties that an effective environmental management system is in place. Adoption of this International Standard, however, will not in itself guarantee optimal environmental outcomes. Application of this International Standard can differ from one organization to another vi due to the context of the organization. Two organizations can carry out similar activities but can have different compliance obligations, commitments in their environmental policy, environmental technologies and environmental performance goals, yet both can conform to the requirements of this International Standard.

It can be briefly described as follows. — Plan: establish environmental objectives and processes necessary to deliver results in accordance with the organization’s environmental policy. — Do: implement the processes as planned. — Check: monitor and measure processes against the environmental policy, including its commitments, environmental objectives and operating criteria, and report the results. — Act: take actions to continually improve.

These requirements include a high level structure, identical core text, and common terms with core definitions, designed to benefit users implementing multiple ISO management system standards. This International Standard does not include requirements specific to other management systems, such as those for quality, occupational health and safety, energy or financial management. However, this International Standard enables an organization to use a common approach and risk-based thinking to integrate its environmental management system with the requirements of other management systems. This International Standard contains the requirements used to assess conformity. An organization that wishes to demonstrate conformity with this International Standard can do so by: — making a self-determination and self-declaration, or — seeking confirmation of its conformance by parties having an interest in the organization, such as customers, or — seeking confirmation of its self-declaration by a party external to the organization, or — seeking certification/registration of its environmental management system by an external organization. Annex A provides explanatory information to prevent misinterpretation of the requirements of this International Standard. Annex B shows broad technical correspondence between the previous edition of this International Standard and this edition. Implementation guidance on environmental management systems is included in ISO 14004. In this International Standard, the following verbal forms are used:— “shall” indicates a requirement; — “should” indicates a recommendation; — “may” indicates a permission; — “can” indicates a possibility or a capability. Information marked as “NOTE” is intended to assist the understanding or use of the document. “Notes to entry” used in Clause 3 provide additional information that supplements the terminological data and can contain provisions relating to the use of a term. The terms and definitions in Clause 3 are arranged in conceptual order, with an alphabetical index provided at the end of the document. viii with guidance for use'),\n",

This International Standard is intended for use by an organization seeking to manage its environmental responsibilities in a systematic manner that contributes to the environmental pillar of sustainability. This International Standard helps an organization achieve the intended outcomes of its environmental management system, which provide value for the environment, the organization itself and interested parties. Consistent with the organization’s environmental policy, the intended outcomes of an environmental management system include: — enhancement of environmental performance; — fulfilment of compliance obligations; — achievement of environmental objectives. This International Standard is applicable to any organization, regardless of size, type and nature, and applies to the environmental aspects of its activities, products and services that the organization determines it can either control or influence considering a life cycle perspective. This International Standard does not state specific environmental performance criteria. This International Standard can be used in whole or in part to systematically improve environmental management. Claims of conformity to this International Standard, however, are not acceptable unless all its requirements are incorporated into an organization’s environmental management system and fulfilled without exclusion.'),\n",

While this information addresses and is consistent with these requirements, it is not intended to add to, subtract from, or in any way modify them. The requirements in this International Standard need to be viewed from a systems or holistic perspective. The user should not read a particular sentence or clause of this International Standard in isolation from other clauses. There is an interrelationship between the requirements in some clauses and the requirements in other clauses. For example, the organization needs to understand the relationship between the commitments in its environmental policy and the requirements that are specified in other clauses. Management of change is an important part of maintaining the environmental management system that ensures the organization can achieve the intended outcomes of its environmental management system on an ongoing basis. Management of change is addressed in various requirements of this International Standard, including — maintaining the environmental management system (see 4.4 ), — environmental aspects (see 6.1.2 ), — internal communication (see 7.4.2 ), — operational control (see 8.1 ), — internal audit programme (see 9.2.2 ), and — management review (see 9.3 ). As part of managing change, the organization should address planned and unplanned changes to ensure that the unintended consequences of these changes do not have a negative effect on the intended outcomes of the environmental management system. Examples of change include: — planned changes to products, processes, operations, equipment or facilities; — changes in staff or external providers, including contractors; — new information related to environmental aspects, environmental impacts and related technologies; — changes in compliance obligations.'),\n",

There is, however, no requirement in this International Standard for its clause structure or terminology to be applied to an organization’s environmental management system documentation. There is no requirement to replace the terms used by an organization with the terms used in this International Standard. Organizations can choose to use terms that suit their business, e.g. “records”, “documentation”, or “protocols”, rather than “documented information”. 18 A.3 Clarification\\tof\\tconcepts In addition to the terms and definitions given in Clause 3, clarification of selected concepts is provided below to prevent misunderstanding. — In this International Standard, the use of the word “any” implies selection or choice. — The words “appropriate” and “applicable” are not interchangeable. “Appropriate” means suitable (for, to) and implies some degree of freedom, while “applicable” means relevant or possible to apply and implies that if it can be done, it needs to be done. — The word “consider” means it is necessary to think about the topic but it can be excluded; whereas “take into account” means it is necessary to think about the topic but it cannot be excluded. — “Continual” indicates duration that occurs over a period of time, but with intervals of interruption (unlike “continuous” which indicates duration without interruption). “Continual” is therefore the appropriate word to use when referring to improvement. — In this International Standard, the word “effect” is used to describe the result of a change to the organization. The phrase “environmental impact” refers specifically to the result of a change to the environment. — The word “ensure” means the responsibility can be delegated, but not the accountability. — This International Standard uses the term “interested party”; the term “stakeholder” is a synonym as it represents the same concept. This International Standard uses some new terminology. A brief explanation is given below to aid both new users and those who have used previous editions of this International Standard. — The phrase “compliance obligations” replaces the phrase “legal requirements and other requirements to which the organization subscribes” used in the previous edition of this International Standard. The intent of this new phrase does not differ from that of the previous edition. — “Documented information” replaces the nouns “documentation”, “documents” and “records” used in previous editions of this International Standard. To distinguish the intent of the generic term “documented information”, this International Standard now uses the phrase “retain documented information as evidence of....” to mean records, and “maintain documented information” to mean documentation other than records. The phrase “as evidence of….” is not a requirement to meet legal evidentiary requirements; its intent is only to indicate objective evidence needs to be retained. — The phrase “external provider” means an external supplier organization (including a contractor) that provides a product or a service. — The change from “identify” to “determine” is intended to harmonize with the standardized management system terminology. The word “determine” implies a discovery process that results in knowledge. The intent does not differ from that of previous editions. — The phrase “intended outcome” is what the organization intends to achieve by implementing its environmental management system. The minimal intended outcomes include enhancement of environmental performance, fulfilment of compliance obligations and achievement of environmental objectives. Organizations can set additional intended outcomes for their environmental management system. For example, consistent with their commitment to protection of the environment, an organization may establish an intended outcome to work towards sustainable development. — The phrase “person(s) doing work under its control” includes persons working for the organization and those working on its behalf for which the organization has responsibility (e.g. contractors). It replaces the phrase “persons working for it or on its behalf” and “persons working for or on behalf of the organization” used in the previous edition of this International Standard. The intent of this new phrase does not differ from that of the previous edition. — The concept of “target” used in previous editions of this International Standard is captured within the term “environmental objective”.

The environmental policy enables the organization to set its environmental objectives (see 6.2), take actions to achieve the intended outcomes of the environmental management system, and achieve continual improvement (see Clause 10). Three basic commitments for the environmental policy are specified in this International Standard to: a) protect the environment; b) fulfil the organization’s compliance obligations; c) continually improve the environmental management system to enhance environmental performance. These commitments are then reflected in the processes an organization establishes to address specific requirements in this International Standard, to ensure a robust, credible and reliable environmental management system. The commitment to protect the environment is intended to not only prevent adverse environmental impacts through prevention of pollution, but to protect the natural environment from harm and degradation arising from the organization’s activities, products and services. The specific commitment(s) an organization pursues should be relevant to the context of the organization, including the local or regional environmental conditions. These commitments can address, for example, water quality, recycling, or air quality, and can also include commitments related to climate change mitigation and adaptation, protection of biodiversity and ecosystems, and restoration. While all the commitments are important, some interested parties are especially concerned with the organization’s commitment to fulfil its compliance obligations, particularly applicable legal requirements. This International Standard specifies a number of interconnected requirements related to this commitment. These include the need to: — determine compliance obligations; — ensure operations are carried out in accordance with these compliance obligations; — evaluate fulfilment of the compliance obligations; — correct nonconformities.'),\n",

The organization can ensure this by determining its risks and opportunities that need to be addressed and planning action to address them. These risks and opportunities can be related to environmental aspects, compliance obligations, other issues or other needs and expectations of interested parties. Environmental aspects (see 6.1.2 ) can create risks and opportunities associated with adverse environmental impacts, beneficial environmental impacts, and other effects on the organization. The risks and opportunities related to environmental aspects can be determined as part of the significance evaluation or determined separately. Compliance obligations (see 6.1.3 ) can create risks and opportunities, such as failing to comply (which can damage the organization’s reputation or result in legal action) or performing beyond its compliance obligations (which can enhance the organization’s reputation). 22 The organization can also have risks and opportunities related to other issues, including environmental conditions or needs and expectations of interested parties, which can affect the organization’s ability to achieve the intended outcomes of its environmental management system, e.g. a) environmental spillage due to literacy or language barriers among workers who cannot understand local work procedures; b) increased flooding due to climate change that could affect the organizations premises; c) lack of available resources to maintain an effective environmental management system due to economic constraints; d) introducing new technology financed by governmental grants, which could improve air quality; e) water scarcity during periods of drought that could affect the organization’s ability to operate its emission control equipment. Emergency situations are unplanned or unexpected events that need the urgent application of specific competencies, resources or processes to prevent or mitigate their actual or potential consequences. Emergency situations can result in adverse environmental impacts or other effects on the organization. When determining potential emergency situations (e.g. fire, chemical spill, severe weather), the organization should consider: — the nature of onsite hazards (e.g. flammable liquids, storage tanks, compressed gasses); — the most likely type and scale of an emergency situation; — the potential for emergency situations at a nearby facility (e.g. plant, road, railway line). Although risks and opportunities need to be determined and addressed, there is no requirement for formal risk management or a documented risk management process. It is up to the organization to select the method it will use to determine its risks and opportunities. The method may involve a simple qualitative process or a full quantitative assessment depending on the context in which the organization operates. The risks and opportunities identified (see 6.1.1 to 6.1.3 ) are inputs for planning actions (see 6.1.4 ) and for establishing the environmental objectives (see 6.2 ).'),\n",
      " Document(metadata={'section_id': 'A.6.1.2', 'parent_id': 'A.6.1', 'parent_title': '', 'requirement_tag': 'Recommendation', 'source': 'ISO standards\\\\ISO_14001_2015(en).pdf'}, page_content='A.6.1.2\\nEnvironmental aspects An organization determines its environmental aspects and associated environmental impacts, and determines those that are significant and, therefore, need to be addressed by its environmental management system. Changes to the environment, either adverse or beneficial, that result wholly or partially from environmental aspects are called environmental impacts. The environmental impact can occur at local, regional and global scales, and also can be direct, indirect or cumulative by nature. The relationship between environmental aspects and environmental impacts is one of cause and effect. When determining environmental aspects, the organization considers a life cycle perspective. This does not require a detailed life cycle assessment; thinking carefully about the life cycle stages that can be controlled or influenced by the organization is sufficient. Typical stages of a product (or service) life cycle include raw material acquisition, design, production, transportation/delivery, use, end-of-life treatment and final disposal. The life cycle stages that are applicable will vary depending on the activity, product or service. An organization needs to determine the environmental aspects within the scope of its environmental management system. It takes into account the inputs and outputs (both intended and unintended) that are associated with its current and relevant past activities, products and services; planned or new developments; and new or modified activities, products and services. The method used should consider normal and abnormal operating conditions, shut-down and start-up conditions, as well as the reasonably foreseeable emergency situations identified in 6.1.1 . Attention should be paid to prior occurrences of emergency situations. For information on environmental aspects as part of managing change, see Clause A.1 . An organization does not have to consider each product, component or raw material individually to determine and evaluate their environmental aspects; it may group or categorize activities, products and services when they have common characteristics. When determining its environmental aspects, the organization can consider:a) emissions to air; b) releases to water; c) releases to land; d) use of raw materials and natural resources; e) use of energy; f) energy emitted (e.g. heat, radiation, vibration (noise), light); g) generation of waste and/or by-products; h) use of space. In addition to the environmental aspects that it can control directly, an organization determines whether there are environmental aspects that it can influence. These can be related to products and services used by the organization which are provided by others, as well as products and services that it provides to others, including those associated with (an) outsourced process(es). With respect to those an organization provides to others, it can have limited influence on the use and end-of-life treatment of the products and services. In all circumstances, however, it is the organization that determines the extent of control it is able to exercise, the environmental aspects it can influence, and the extent to which it chooses to exercise such influence. Consideration should be given to environmental aspects related to the organization’s activities, products and services, such as: — design and development of its facilities, processes, products and services; — acquisition of raw materials, including extraction; — operational or manufacturing processes, including warehousing; — operation and maintenance of facilities, organizational assets and infrastructure; — environmental performance and practices of external providers; — product transportation and service delivery, including packaging; — storage, use and end-of-life treatment of products; — waste management, including reuse, refurbishing, recycling and disposal. There is no single method for determining significant environmental aspects, however, the method and criteria used should provide consistent results. The organization sets the criteria for determining its significant environmental aspects. Environmental criteria are the primary and minimum criteria for assessing environmental aspects. Criteria can relate to the environmental aspect (e.g. type, size, frequency) or the environmental impact (e.g. scale, severity, duration, exposure). Other criteria may also be used. An environmental aspect might not be significant when only considering environmental criteria. It can, however, reach or exceed the threshold for determining significance when other criteria are considered. These other criteria can include organizational issues, such as legal requirements or interested party concerns. These other criteria are not intended to be used to downgrade an aspect that is significant based on its environmental impact. 24 A significant environmental aspect can result in one or more significant environmental impacts, and can therefore result in risks and opportunities that need to be addressed to ensure the organization can achieve the intended outcomes of its environmental management system.'),\n",

Mandatory legal requirements related to an organization’s environmental aspects can include, if applicable: a) requirements from governmental entities or other relevant authorities; b) international, national and local laws and regulations; c) requirements specified in permits, licenses or other forms of authorization; d) orders, rules or guidance from regulatory agencies; e) judgements of courts or administrative tribunals. Compliance obligations also include other interested party requirements related to its environmental management system which the organization has to or chooses to adopt.

The actions planned may include establishing environmental objectives (see 6.2) or may be incorporated into other environmental management system processes, either individually or in combination. Some actions may be addressed through other management systems, such as those related to occupational health and safety or business continuity, or through other business processes related to risk, financial or human resource management.

The strategic level includes the highest levels of the organization and the environmental objectives can be applicable to the whole organization.

Environmental objectives should be communicated to persons working under the organization’s control who have the ability to influence the achievement of environmental objectives. The requirement to “take into account significant environmental aspects” does not mean that an environmental objective has to be established for each significant environmental aspect, however, these have a high priority when establishing environmental objectives. “Consistent with the environmental policy” means that the environmental objectives are broadly aligned and harmonized with the commitments made by top management in the environmental policy, including the commitment to continual improvement. Indicators are selected to evaluate the achievement of measurable environmental objectives. “Measurable” means it is possible to use either quantitative or qualitative methods in relation to a specified scale to determine if the environmental objective has been achieved. By specifying “if practicable”, it is acknowledged that there can be situations when it is not feasible to measure an environmental objective, however, it is important that the organization is able to determine whether or not an environmental objective has been achieved.

These impressions or views can be positive or negative. In the latter case (e.g. complaints), it is important that a prompt and clear answer is provided by the organization. A subsequent analysis of these complaints can provide valuable information for detecting improvement opportunities for the environmental management system. Communication should:a) be transparent, i.e. the organization is open in the way it derives what it has reported on; b) be appropriate, so that information meets the needs of relevant interested parties, enabling them to participate; c) be truthful and not misleading to those who rely on the information reported; d) be factual, accurate and able to be trusted; e) not exclude relevant information; f) be understandable to interested parties.

The EnMS utilizes interrelated elements such as energy performance indicators (EnPIs) and energy baselines (EnBs) as a means to demonstrate measurable improvements in energy efficiency or energy consumption, related to energy use (see Figure A.1). Figure A.1 — Relationship between energy performance and EnMS While this document requires demonstration of energy performance improvement, it is the organization that defines its energy performance and energy targets as well as how energy performance improvement will be demonstrated. A.3 Clarification\\tof\\tterminology The clause structure and some of the terminology of this document have been changed from the previous edition to improve alignment with other management system standards. There is, however, no requirement in this document for its clause structure or terminology to be applied to an organization’s EnMS documentation. There is no requirement to replace the terms used by an organization with the terms used in this document. Organizations can choose to use terms that suit their business and needs, or to use those found in this document. — In this document, the use of the word “any” implies selection or choice. — The words “appropriate” and “applicable” are not interchangeable. “Appropriate” means suitable (for, to) and implies some degree of freedom, while “applicable” means relevant or possible to apply and implies that if it can be done, it needs to be done. — The word “consider” means it is necessary to think about the topic but it can be excluded, whereas “take into account” means it is necessary to think about the topic but it cannot be excluded. — The word “ensure” means the responsibility can be delegated, but not the accountability. — This document uses the term “interested party”; the term “stakeholder” is a synonym as it represents the same concept. This edition uses some new terminology. A brief explanation is given below. As part of the alignment with other management system standards, a common clause on documented information has been adopted without significant change or addition (see 7.5). Consequently, the terms “documented procedure” and “record” have both been replaced throughout the text by “documented information”. — “Documented information” replaces the nouns “documentation”, “documents” and “records” used in previous editions of this document. To distinguish the intent of the generic term “documented information”, this document now uses the phrase “retain documented information...” to mean records, and “maintain documented information” to mean documentation other than records that is kept up to date. — The phrase “intended outcome” is what the organization intends to achieve by implementing its EnMS and working toward improved energy performance. — The phrase “person(s) doing work under its control” includes persons working for the organization and those working on its behalf for which the organization has responsibility (e.g. contractors, service providers). It replaces the phrase “persons working for it or on its behalf” and “persons working for or on behalf of the organization” used in the previous edition of this document. The intent of this new phrase does not differ from that of the previous edition. A.'),\n",

In determining its SEUs, the organization determines the criteria for what is substantial energy consumption and/or what is a considerable potential for energy performance improvement. SEUs can be defined depending on the needs of the organization, such as by facility (e.g. warehouse, factory, office), by process or system (e.g. lighting, steam, transport, electrolysis, motor- driven) or equipment (e.g. motor, boiler). Once identified, the management and control of SEUs are an integral part of the EnMS. Person(s) working under the control of the organization can include service contractors, part-time personnel and temporary staff. 22 Updating the energy review includes updating the data and information related to the analysis of energy use and energy consumption, determination of SEUs and identification of opportunities for improving energy performance. Not all parts of the energy review need to be updated at the same time. A formal energy audit can be used to assist in identifying opportunities for energy performance improvement in detail. An energy audit can provide information on one or more parts of the energy review. The scope of an energy audit can comprise a detailed review of the energy performance of an organization, SEU(s), systems, energy-using processes and/or equipment. It is typically based on appropriate measurement and observation of actual energy performance for the defined energy audit scope. Energy audit outputs typically include information on current energy consumption and energy performance, and they can be accompanied by a series of specific recommendations ranked by energy performance improvement or financial return on investment, based on analysis of specific site data and operating conditions. When looking for energy performance improvement opportunities, organizations should consider the extent to which energy is required for a particular process, or is recoverable. Even where a process such as a chemical reaction has limited improvement opportunities due to the energy requirements based on scientific laws, the auxiliary equipment can offer significant energy performance improvement potential, as can improved process control or equipment scheduling. Opportunities can also emerge over time due to changes in operating loads and parameters, equipment degradation and improvements in available technologies and techniques. Opportunities can also be identified in how equipment and systems are operated and maintained. The installation of a renewable energy type within the scope and boundaries of the EnMS, as defined by the organization, does not represent an energy performance improvement. Energy consumption across the boundary can decrease, however, there will be no measurable improvement in energy efficiency or energy consumption related to energy use as a result of the change. The consumption of renewable energy can have a positive environmental effect and other benefits and an organization can have an objective to increase its installation of renewable energy. In such cases, an organization needs to assess the renewable energy production separately. Where appropriate, an energy review can also consider security and availability of energy supply.'),\n",

In the context of continual improvement, the expectation is that improvements occur periodically, over time. The rate, extent and timescale of actions that support continual improvement are determined by the organization, in light of its context, economic factors and other circumstances. Energy performance improvement can be demonstrated in several ways, such as: a) reduction in normalized energy consumption for the scope and boundaries of the EnMS; b) progress toward the energy target(s) and management of the SEUs. It is recognized that improvements are achieved based on the priorities of the organization. Examples of continual energy performance improvement include, but are not limited to, the following. — Total energy consumption decreases over time under similar conditions, e.g. a commercial building in a region where the temperature does not vary significantly. — Total energy consumption increases, but the measure of energy performance as defined by the organization improves. In this case, a simple ratio where there is one relevant variable and no baseload. — Equipment has a predicted reduction in energy performance as it ages. A delay or reduction in the performance reduction curve due to proper operational and maintenance controls can demonstrate improved energy performance as defined by the organizational EnPIs. — In resource extraction industries where energy performance tends to decline as resources are depleted, e.g. in a mining facility where the depth and production both vary, reducing the rate of decline relative to the EnB can be considered a performance improvement. — In most situations and organizations, there are multiple relevant variables requiring normalization, e.g. a dairy producing three different products (milk, cheese, yogurt) and affected by weather. 26 © ISO 2018 – All rights reserved'),\n",

Compliance-related nonconformities need to be corrected, even if those nonconformities have not resulted in actual non-compliance with legal requirements.', 'requirement_tag': 'General', 'source': 'ISO standards\\\\ISO_IEC_30134-1_2016(en).pdf'}, page_content='A.2 Data\\tcentre\\tavailability\\tobjectives\\nThe availability objectives of a data centre can restrict such improvements due to the use of redundant infrastructure components and infrastructures necessary to respond the following circumstances: a) the user of the data centre will either set or demand a series of service level agreements (SLAs) based upon the criticality of their business case covering continuity and quality of power and environmental control provision, connectivity and security; b) the SLAs will reflect directly the appetite for risk that the user has and their ability or willingness to accept shutdowns for maintenance and repairs in the critical systems; c) data centres whose users can accept high levels of risk, scheduled shutdowns for maintenance and shutdowns for fault repair can reach very low design KPIs; d) data centres whose users cannot accept risk of failure and demand concurrent maintenance and inherent fault tolerance are limited by those SLAs to a higher design (and actual) KPI than those facilities described above. Infrastructure design solutions to provide increasing availability are described in a number of International Standards including the EN 50600 series. These solutions generally range from “single- path (no redundancy of components)” to “multi-path (fault tolerant even during maintenance)”. The power supply and distribution system provides an example of the relationship between absolute energy consumption (contribution to KPIs) and availability of service (level of SLA). Typically, IT equipment will be impacted by disruption of supply lasting longer than 10 ms and as a result, uninterruptible power supply (UPS) systems are generally used to support utility power grid systems unable to meet the IT equipment needs. IEC 62040-3 describes the topologies of UPS systems and, in general, the maximum efficiency for each technology reduces as the degree of protection increases. As a result, the availability architecture and the level of protection will dictate the contribution to KPIs which address energy consumption of the power supply and distribution system. Tolerance to faults and ensuring availability to meet SLAs are important factors in the energy consumption of data centre equipment and infrastructures including environmental control. The criticality level and redundancy employed to the power delivery, cooling, IT and IT support systems are key factors in the resource consumption, effectiveness or efficiency levels of the data centre. A.3 Data centre location Resource availability and consumption can be impacted by physical location. For example, free-cooling (compressor-less mechanical thermal management) is less effective for higher external temperatures. 10 Bibliography [1] IEC 62040-3, Uninterruptible power systems (UPS) — Part 3: Method of specifying the performance and test requirements [2] EN 50600 series, Information technology — Data centre facilities and infrastructures Price based on 11 pages')]\n"
