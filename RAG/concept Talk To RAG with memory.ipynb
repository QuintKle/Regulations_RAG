Infrastructure design solutions to provide increasing availability are described in a number of International Standards including the EN 50600 series. These solutions generally range from “single- path (no redundancy of components)” to “multi-path (fault tolerant even during maintenance)”. The power supply and distribution system provides an example of the relationship between absolute energy consumption (contribution to KPIs) and availability of service (level of SLA). Typically, IT equipment will be impacted by disruption of supply lasting longer than 10 ms and as a result, uninterruptible power supply (UPS) systems are generally used to support utility power grid systems unable to meet the IT equipment needs. IEC 62040-3 describes the topologies of UPS systems and, in general, the maximum efficiency for each technology reduces as the degree of protection increases. As a result, the availability architecture and the level of protection will dictate the contribution to KPIs which address energy consumption of the power supply and distribution system. Tolerance to faults and ensuring availability to meet SLAs are important factors in the energy consumption of data centre equipment and infrastructures including environmental control. The criticality level and redundancy employed to the power delivery, cooling, IT and IT support systems are key factors in the resource consumption, effectiveness or efficiency levels of the data centre. A.3 Data centre location Resource availability and consumption can be impacted by physical location. For example, free-cooling (compressor-less mechanical thermal management) is less effective for higher external temperatures. 10 Bibliography [1] IEC 62040-3, Uninterruptible power systems (UPS) — Part 3: Method of specifying the performance and test requirements [2] EN 50600 series, Information technology — Data centre facilities and infrastructures Price based on 11 pages', 'section_id': 'A.2', 'parent_id': 'A', 'parent_title': 'A non-compliance is not necessarily elevated to a nonconformity if, for example, it is identified and corrected by the environmental management system processes.

These requirements include a high level structure, identical core text, and common terms with core definitions, designed to benefit users implementing multiple ISO management system standards. This International Standard does not include requirements specific to other management systems, such as those for quality, occupational health and safety, energy or financial management. However, this International Standard enables an organization to use a common approach and risk-based thinking to integrate its environmental management system with the requirements of other management systems. This International Standard contains the requirements used to assess conformity. An organization that wishes to demonstrate conformity with this International Standard can do so by: — making a self-determination and self-declaration, or — seeking confirmation of its conformance by parties having an interest in the organization, such as customers, or — seeking confirmation of its self-declaration by a party external to the organization, or — seeking certification/registration of its environmental management system by an external organization. Annex A provides explanatory information to prevent misinterpretation of the requirements of this International Standard. Annex B shows broad technical correspondence between the previous edition of this International Standard and this edition.

Infrastructure design solutions to provide increasing availability are described in a number of International Standards including the EN 50600 series. These solutions generally range from “single- path (no redundancy of components)” to “multi-path (fault tolerant even during maintenance)”. The power supply and distribution system provides an example of the relationship between absolute energy consumption (contribution to KPIs) and availability of service (level of SLA). Typically, IT equipment will be impacted by disruption of supply lasting longer than 10 ms and as a result, uninterruptible power supply (UPS) systems are generally used to support utility power grid systems unable to meet the IT equipment needs. IEC 62040-3 describes the topologies of UPS systems and, in general, the maximum efficiency for each technology reduces as the degree of protection increases. As a result, the availability architecture and the level of protection will dictate the contribution to KPIs which address energy consumption of the power supply and distribution system. Tolerance to faults and ensuring availability to meet SLAs are important factors in the energy consumption of data centre equipment and infrastructures including environmental control. The criticality level and redundancy employed to the power delivery, cooling, IT and IT support systems are key factors in the resource consumption, effectiveness or efficiency levels of the data centre. A.3 Data centre location Resource availability and consumption can be impacted by physical location.

Infrastructure design solutions to provide increasing availability are described in a number of International Standards including the EN 50600 series. These solutions generally range from “single- path (no redundancy of components)” to “multi-path (fault tolerant even during maintenance)”. The power supply and distribution system provides an example of the relationship between absolute energy consumption (contribution to KPIs) and availability of service (level of SLA). Typically, IT equipment will be impacted by disruption of supply lasting longer than 10 ms and as a result, uninterruptible power supply (UPS) systems are generally used to support utility power grid systems unable to meet the IT equipment needs. IEC 62040-3 describes the topologies of UPS systems and, in general, the maximum efficiency for each technology reduces as the degree of protection increases. As a result, the availability architecture and the level of protection will dictate the contribution to KPIs which address energy consumption of the power supply and distribution system. Tolerance to faults and ensuring availability to meet SLAs are important factors in the energy consumption of data centre equipment and infrastructures including environmental control. The criticality level and redundancy employed to the power delivery, cooling, IT and IT support systems are key factors in the resource consumption, effectiveness or efficiency levels of the data centre. A.3 Data centre location Resource availability and consumption can be impacted by physical location. For example, free-cooling (compressor-less mechanical thermal management) is less effective for higher external temperatures. 10 Bibliography [1] IEC 62040-3, Uninterruptible power systems (UPS) — Part 3: Method of specifying the performance and test requirements [2] EN 50600 series, Information technology — Data centre facilities and infrastructures Price based on 11 pages', 'section_id': 'A.2', 'parent_id': 'A', 'parent_title': 'A non-compliance is not necessarily elevated to a nonconformity if, for example, it is identified and corrected by the environmental management system processes.

These requirements include a high level structure, identical core text, and common terms with core definitions, designed to benefit users implementing multiple ISO management system standards. This International Standard does not include requirements specific to other management systems, such as those for quality, occupational health and safety, energy or financial management. However, this International Standard enables an organization to use a common approach and risk-based thinking to integrate its environmental management system with the requirements of other management systems. This International Standard contains the requirements used to assess conformity. An organization that wishes to demonstrate conformity with this International Standard can do so by: — making a self-determination and self-declaration, or — seeking confirmation of its conformance by parties having an interest in the organization, such as customers, or — seeking confirmation of its self-declaration by a party external to the organization, or — seeking certification/registration of its environmental management system by an external organization. Annex A provides explanatory information to prevent misinterpretation of the requirements of this International Standard. Annex B shows broad technical correspondence between the previous edition of this International Standard and this edition. Implementation guidance on environmental management systems is included in ISO 14004. In this International Standard, the following verbal forms are used:— “shall” indicates a requirement; — “should” indicates a recommendation; — “may” indicates a permission; — “can” indicates a possibility or a capability. Information marked as “NOTE” is intended to assist the understanding or use of the document. “Notes to entry” used in Clause 3 provide additional information that supplements the terminological data and can contain provisions relating to the use of a term.

As a result, the impact of targets for data centre reliability and availability should be taken into consideration when reviewing KPI results (for further information, see Annex A).', 'section_id': '5.5', 'parent_id': '5', 'parent_title': '5 Leadership', 'requirement_tag': 'Requirement', 'source': 'ISO standards\\\\ISO_IEC_30134-1_2016(en).pdf'}}, {'ID': 'bb99c695-02ea-44aa-8673-63341ccc5c96', 'rrf_score': 0.0136986301369863, 'payload': {'content': 'CoC No: 9.3.4, Name: Achieved free cooling / economised cooling hours, Description: Require reporting of full free cooling, partial free cooling and full refrigerant and compressor based cooling hours throughout the year.The intent being to report the amount or time and energy spent running on mechanical refrigerant and compressor based cooling versus the use of free cooling in order to reduce the amount of time spent on mechanical cooling during the year.

Examples are as follows:a) minimization of energy and other resource consumption; b) effectiveness of the IT load (processing, storage and transport) within the data centre, maximizing the IT output with the minimum energy consumption; c) reuse of unconsumed resources (e.g. energy reuse in the form of waste heat); d) utilization of renewable energy, both generated on site and off site. The KPIs of the ISO/IEC 30134 series are designed and intended to allow an individual facility to measure and monitor progress in each individual area so as to justify investment in resource usage effectiveness or efficiency measures and plan further improvements.
